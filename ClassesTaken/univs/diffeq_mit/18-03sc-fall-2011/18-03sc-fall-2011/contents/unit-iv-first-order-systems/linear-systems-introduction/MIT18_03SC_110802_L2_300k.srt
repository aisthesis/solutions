00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,071

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,270
PROFESSOR: Welcome in
this recitation.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,240
So we're going to talk about
linear systems of equations.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,030
So in the first question,
we are

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,790
given a system of equations.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,290
X dot equals 6x plus 5y.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,660
Y dot equals x plus 2y.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,350
We're asked to write this
system in matrix form.

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,390
The second part asks us to
convert a differential

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,890
equation of second order, x dot
dot plus 8x dot plus 7x

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,320
equals to zero into matrix form,
basically into system of

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,300
ODEs, similar to
the first part.

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
In the third part of the
problem, we're asked to

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,030
interpret the population model,
x dot equals 2x minus

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,820
3y, y dot equals x minus y.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,380
So here, x and y are modeling
either a prey or predator.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,210
And you're asked to think about
the interpretation of

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,220
the system to determine
which of x or y is

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,630
the prey or the predator.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,140
So why don't you take
a few minutes?

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,720
Think about these three
questions, and

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,970
I'll be right back.

23
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:15,190

24
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,900
Welcome back.

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,830
So for the first question,
basically, we're asked to

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,460
write this system
in matrix form.

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,110
So we have xy derivative for
that left-hand side.

28
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,630
You need to write this in
the form of a matrix

29
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,920
multiplying x and y.

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,550
So here, we would
have 6, 5, 1, 2.

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,470
And that would be our system of
differential equations in

32
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,760
matrix form.

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,010
And what we would be solving
for would be the vector xy.

34
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,910
The second part of the problem,
we need to do the

35
00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:02,780
opposite, go from the second
order differential equation

36
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,450
into matrix form.

37
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:12,020
So to do that, we introduced a
new variable, y equals x dot.

38
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,190
And from that point, we can
then write x dot, dot.

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,620
So if I'm going to just start
with what we know about the

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,570
equation, x dot, dot equals--

41
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,780
let me write it in a system
first before I do it in a

42
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,030
vector form.

43
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,240

44
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,790
We would write x dot, dot equals
minus 7x minus 8x dot.

45
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,760
But we introduced a new variable
x dot equals 2y.

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,630
So we have minus 7x minus 8y.

47
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,540
So now, the other equation we
need is the one that tells us

48
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,050
what this y is.

49
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:56,070
So we have x dot equals to y,
which is the new variable that

50
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,200
we introduced here.

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,570
And so we go from a second order
differential equation

52
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,740
into a system of two
differential equations that we

53
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,080
can write now in vectorial form
in matrix form, like we

54
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:15,200
did for the first part, as
x, x dot which is just y.

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,480
I'm just going to write this
like this, it's just from what

56
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:30,330
we defined, equals to, again,
x,y like we did previously.

57
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,850
And now we have to read off
our system to find the

58
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,690
coefficient of this matrix.

59
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,720
So x dot equals to y means that
there is zero coefficient

60
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,690
in front of the x, a 1
in front of the y.

61
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,380
X dot, dot equals minus 7x.

62
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,440
So we will have a minus 7
multiplying the x and minus 8

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,690
multiplying the y.

64
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,750

65
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,720
And so that's how we convert a
differential equation, so I

66
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,200
can order into the systems of
differential equations in

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,120
matrix form.

68
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,660
And this matrix would be
referred to the companion

69
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,480
matrix of these differential
equations.

70
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,350
OK, so that ends the
second part.

71
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,240

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:21,540
So now for the third question,
we're asked to interpret this

73
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,890
population dynamics system
of equation.

74
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:34,100
Minus 3y, y dot equals
x minus y.

75
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,220
So the question was, we
have two species.

76
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,300
Which one is the prey, which
one is the predator?

77
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,030
So how do we go about
figuring this out?

78
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,140
Let's look at how x dot varies
with y or basically variable x

79
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,070
varies with y.

80
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,870
Here, we can see that we have a
coefficient that is minus 3.

81
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,330
It is negative, which means that
when y increases, we have

82
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,990
a more and more negative x
dot, which means that the

83
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,430
value of x goes down.

84
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,220
So as the population y
increases, we have a decrease

85
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,270
of population x, which suggests
that y is a predator

86
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,720
eating up population x.

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,550
And if you look at the
equation for y, we

88
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,140
have x minus y.

89
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,530
And here, what we see is that
when x increases, the

90
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,520
population y then increases.

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,550
So that definitely confirms that
y is our predator that

92
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,050
basically increases by feeding
on the population x.

93
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:36,640
And as it feeds on population
x, y increases, which means

94
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,620
that here this term becomes more
and more negative, which

95
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,310
means x decreases in turn.

96
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,000
And these two terms could be
modeling, for example, here

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,350
just the growth of the
population, so

98
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,140
birth term of the prey.

99
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,390
And these minus y here could
be your small link, for

100
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,340
example, a death rate
of these predators.

101
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,000
And so we have x prey
and y predator.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,480

103
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,610
So from this recitation, we
learned how to convert a

104
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,430
system of differential equations
to matrix form.

105
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,770
We learned how to convert a
second order differential

106
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,660
equation into also matrix form,
or basically system

107
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,520
differential equation
introducing notion of

108
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,740
companion matrix.

109
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,340
And we learned how to interpret
a system of

110
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,360
differential equations in terms
of what populations

111
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,040
could it be modeling or what
dynamics it could be modeling.

112
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,290
So that ends the recitation.

113
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,045
