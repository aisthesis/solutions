2
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
Today's lecture is going to be
basically devoted to working out

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11
a single example of a nonlinear
system, but it is a very good

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
example because it illustrates
three things which you really

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
have to know about nonlinear
systems.

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:24
I have indicated them by three
cryptic words on the board,

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
but you will see at different
points in the lecture what they

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:34
refer to.
Each of these represents

9
00:00:31 --> 00:00:37
something you need to know about
nonlinear systems to be able to

10
00:00:36 --> 00:00:42
effectively analyze them.
In addition,

11
00:00:39 --> 00:00:45
I am not allowed to collect any
more work, according to the

12
00:00:43 --> 00:00:49
faculty rules,
after today.

13
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
And, of course,
I won't.

14
00:00:47 --> 00:00:53
But, nonetheless,
the final will contain material

15
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
from the reading assignment G7,
and I will be touching on all

16
00:00:55 --> 00:01:01
of these today,
and 7.4, just a couple of pages

17
00:00:59 --> 00:01:05
of that.
You will see its connection.

18
00:01:03 --> 00:01:09
It discusses the same example
we are going to do today.

19
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
And then I suggest those three
exercises to try to solidify

20
00:01:11 --> 00:01:17
what the lecture is about.

21
00:01:14 --> 00:01:20

22
00:01:21 --> 00:01:27
Instead of introducing the
nonlinear system right away that

23
00:01:24 --> 00:01:30
we are going to talk about,
I would like to first explain,

24
00:01:28 --> 00:01:34
so that it won't interrupt the
presentation later,

25
00:01:31 --> 00:01:37
what I mean by a conversion to
a first-order equation.

26
00:01:35 --> 00:01:41

27
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
For that why don't we look at --

28
00:01:44 --> 00:01:50

29
00:01:49 --> 00:01:55
Maybe I can do it here.
Our system looks like this,

30
00:01:52 --> 00:01:58
dx over dt.
For once, I am not writing x

31
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
prime because I want to
explicitly indicate what the

32
00:01:59 --> 00:02:05
independent variable is.
It is a nonlinear autonomous

33
00:02:04 --> 00:02:10
system, so there is no t on the
right-hand side.

34
00:02:07 --> 00:02:13
But this is not a simple linear
function, ax plus by.

35
00:02:11 --> 00:02:17
It is more complicated,

36
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
like you had in the
predator-prey robin-earthworm

37
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
problem that you worked on last
night.

38
00:02:20 --> 00:02:26
And the other equation will be
g of (x, y).

39
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
This is the system,
and explicitly it is nonlinear

40
00:02:26 --> 00:02:32
in general and autonomous,
as I have indicated on the

41
00:02:30 --> 00:02:36
right-hand side.
Now, remember that the

42
00:02:35 --> 00:02:41
geometric picture of this was as
a velocity field.

43
00:02:40 --> 00:02:46
You made a velocity field out
of the vectors whose components

44
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
were f and g,
so that is (f)i plus (g)j,

45
00:02:50 --> 00:02:56
but what it looked like was a

46
00:02:55 --> 00:03:01
plane filled up with a lot of
vectors pointing different ways

47
00:03:01 --> 00:03:07
according to the velocity at the
point was.

48
00:03:07 --> 00:03:13
And side-by-side with that went
the solutions.

49
00:03:11 --> 00:03:17
A typical solution was x equals
x of t,

50
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
y equals y of t
represented as a column vector.

51
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
And that is a parametric
equation.

52
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
And the geometric picture of
that was given by its

53
00:03:28 --> 00:03:34
trajectory.
When you plotted it,

54
00:03:31 --> 00:03:37
it was a trajectory.
It had not only the right

55
00:03:35 --> 00:03:41
direction at each point,
in other words,

56
00:03:38 --> 00:03:44
but it also had to have the
right velocity at each point.

57
00:03:43 --> 00:03:49
In other words,
sometimes the point was moving

58
00:03:46 --> 00:03:52
rapidly and sometimes it was
moving more slowly along that

59
00:03:51 --> 00:03:57
path.
And the way it moved was an

60
00:03:54 --> 00:04:00
important part of the solution.
Now, what I plan to do is --

61
00:04:00 --> 00:04:06
The conversation that I am
talking about takes place by

62
00:04:05 --> 00:04:11
eliminating t.

63
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13

64
00:04:14 --> 00:04:20
Now, why would one want to do
that?

65
00:04:16 --> 00:04:22
t, after all,
is an essential part of the

66
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
solution.
It is an essential part of this

67
00:04:21 --> 00:04:27
picture because without t you
would not know how long the

68
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
arrows were supposed to be.
You would still know their

69
00:04:28 --> 00:04:34
direction.
And, of course,

70
00:04:31 --> 00:04:37
it occurs in here.
Now, let's take the first step

71
00:04:34 --> 00:04:40
and eliminate t from the system
itself.

72
00:04:37 --> 00:04:43
As you see, that is very easy
to do because the right-hand

73
00:04:41 --> 00:04:47
side has no t in it anyway and
the left-hand side has the t

74
00:04:45 --> 00:04:51
only as the denominators of the
differential quotients.

75
00:04:49 --> 00:04:55
The obvious way to eliminate t
is just to divide one equation

76
00:04:54 --> 00:05:00
by the other.
And since usually we think of

77
00:04:57 --> 00:05:03
not dx by dy,
but dy by dx,

78
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
I will vow --
What is dy over dx?

79
00:05:04 --> 00:05:10
Well, if I divide this equation
by that equation,

80
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
dy by dt divided by dx by dt,

81
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
according to the chain rule,
or according to commonsense,

82
00:05:17 --> 00:05:23
you cancel the dt's and you get
dy over dx.

83
00:05:22 --> 00:05:28
And, on the right-hand side,
you get g of (x,

84
00:05:26 --> 00:05:32
y) divided by f of (x,
y).

85
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
But what is that?
That is the equation of the

86
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
first day of the term.
By taking that single step,

87
00:05:38 --> 00:05:44
I convert this nonlinear
system, which we virtually never

88
00:05:44 --> 00:05:50
find explicit solutions to,
into an ordinary first order

89
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
equation which,
in fact, you also don't usually

90
00:05:54 --> 00:06:00
find explicit solutions to,
except with our narrow blinders

91
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
on.
We only get problems at the

92
00:06:04 --> 00:06:10
beginning of 18.03 where there
will be an explicit solution to

93
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
this.
I have converted the nonlinear

94
00:06:12 --> 00:06:18
system to a single first order
equation to which I can apply

95
00:06:18 --> 00:06:24
the usual first order methods
that include hope that I will be

96
00:06:23 --> 00:06:29
able to solve it.
Now, what do I lose?

97
00:06:26 --> 00:06:32
Well, what happens to this
picture?

98
00:06:31 --> 00:06:37
If you don't have the t in it
anymore then you don't have

99
00:06:35 --> 00:06:41
velocity, you don't have arrows
with a length to them because

100
00:06:39 --> 00:06:45
the length gives you how fast
the point is going.

101
00:06:43 --> 00:06:49
Without t I don't know at any
point how fast it is supposed to

102
00:06:47 --> 00:06:53
be going.
All I know at any point (x,

103
00:06:50 --> 00:06:56
y) is no longer dx over dt
and dy over dt.

104
00:06:54 --> 00:07:00
All I know is dy over dx.

105
00:06:56 --> 00:07:02
In other words,

106
00:06:58 --> 00:07:04
the corresponding picture,
if I eliminate t from this

107
00:07:02 --> 00:07:08
picture all that is left is the
directions of each of these

108
00:07:06 --> 00:07:12
arrows.
What disappears is their

109
00:07:10 --> 00:07:16
length.
And, in fact,

110
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
since dy over dx is
purely a slope,

111
00:07:15 --> 00:07:21
I cannot even tell whether the
point is traveling this way or

112
00:07:19 --> 00:07:25
that way.
It doesn't make any sense to

113
00:07:22 --> 00:07:28
have the point traveling anymore
since there is no time in which

114
00:07:27 --> 00:07:33
it can do its traveling.
So that picture gets changed to

115
00:07:32 --> 00:07:38
the direction field.
The corresponding picture now,

116
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
all you do is take each of
these arrows,

117
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
you snip it off to a standard
length, being careful to snip

118
00:07:45 --> 00:07:51
off the little pointy end,
and it becomes nothing but a

119
00:07:50 --> 00:07:56
line element.
And all it has is a slope.

120
00:07:53 --> 00:07:59
What corresponds to the
velocity field here is now just

121
00:07:58 --> 00:08:04
our slope field or our direction
field.

122
00:08:03 --> 00:08:09
All we know is the slope at
each point.

123
00:08:05 --> 00:08:11
How about the solution?
Well, if I have eliminated

124
00:08:09 --> 00:08:15
time, the solution is no longer
a pair of parametric equations.

125
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
It is just an equation
involving x and y.

126
00:08:16 --> 00:08:22
I can hope that the solution
will be explicit,

127
00:08:19 --> 00:08:25
y equals y of x,
but you already know from the

128
00:08:24 --> 00:08:30
first days of the term that
sometimes it isn't.

129
00:08:27 --> 00:08:33
Let's call that explicit
solution.

130
00:08:31 --> 00:08:37
Often you have to settle for
it.

131
00:08:33 --> 00:08:39
And sometimes it is not a pain.
It is something that is even

132
00:08:38 --> 00:08:44
better.
Settle for a solution which

133
00:08:41 --> 00:08:47
looks like this which is y
defined implicitly as a function

134
00:08:46 --> 00:08:52
of x.
And what does the picture of

135
00:08:48 --> 00:08:54
that look like?
Well, the picture of this is

136
00:08:52 --> 00:08:58
now simply an integral curve.
It is not a trajectory anymore.

137
00:08:57 --> 00:09:03
It is what we called an
integral curve.

138
00:09:02 --> 00:09:08
I am reminding you of the very
first day of the term,

139
00:09:05 --> 00:09:11
or maybe the second day.
And all it has at each point

140
00:09:08 --> 00:09:14
the right slope because that is
all the field is telling me now.

141
00:09:12 --> 00:09:18
It only has a slope at each
point.

142
00:09:14 --> 00:09:20
It doesn't have any magnitude
or direction.

143
00:09:17 --> 00:09:23
It has the direction,
but it doesn't have direction

144
00:09:20 --> 00:09:26
in the sense of an arrow telling
me whether it is going this way

145
00:09:24 --> 00:09:30
or the opposite way.
That is the picture with t in

146
00:09:27 --> 00:09:33
it.
These are the corresponding

147
00:09:30 --> 00:09:36
degeneration of that.
It is a coarsening,

148
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
it's a cheapening of it.
It is throwing away

149
00:09:36 --> 00:09:42
information.
Throw away all the information

150
00:09:39 --> 00:09:45
that had to do with t,
and we are back in the first

151
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
days of the terms with a single
first order equations involving

152
00:09:46 --> 00:09:52
only x and y with solutions that
involve only x and y with curves

153
00:09:50 --> 00:09:56
that are the graphs of these
solutions but again have no t in

154
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
them.
In effect, they are just the

155
00:09:57 --> 00:10:03
paths of the trajectories.
Whereas, the trajectory is the

156
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
point that shows actually how
the point is moving along in

157
00:10:07 --> 00:10:13
time faster or slower at various
points.

158
00:10:11 --> 00:10:17
Now, why would one want to lose
information?

159
00:10:15 --> 00:10:21
Well, the great gain is that
this might be solvable.

160
00:10:19 --> 00:10:25
Whereas, this almost certainly
is not.

161
00:10:23 --> 00:10:29
That is a big plus.
For example,

162
00:10:25 --> 00:10:31
let's illustrate it on the very
simplest possible case.

163
00:10:32 --> 00:10:38

164
00:10:38 --> 00:10:44
I cannot illustrate it on a
nonlinear system very well,

165
00:10:41 --> 00:10:47
or not right now because,
in general, nonlinear systems

166
00:10:45 --> 00:10:51
are not solvable.
Let's take an easy example.

167
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
Suppose the system were a
linear one, let's say this one

168
00:10:53 --> 00:10:59
that we have talked about
before, in fact.

169
00:10:56 --> 00:11:02
That is a simple linear
two-by-two system.

170
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
This means the derivatives with
respect to time.

171
00:11:02 --> 00:11:08
Well, you know that the
solutions we talked about in

172
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
fact, last time,
typical solutions that would be

173
00:11:09 --> 00:11:15
something like (x,
y) equals a constant times,

174
00:11:11 --> 00:11:17
let's say if x is cosine t
then y would be the

175
00:11:15 --> 00:11:21
derivative of that,
which is negative sine t.

176
00:11:18 --> 00:11:24
Or, another one would be c2

177
00:11:21 --> 00:11:27
times sine t,
cosine t.

178
00:11:23 --> 00:11:29

179
00:11:25 --> 00:11:31

180
00:11:30 --> 00:11:36
And those, of course,
are circles.

181
00:11:32 --> 00:11:38
They are parametrized circles,
so they are circles that go

182
00:11:37 --> 00:11:43
around, in fact,
in this direction.

183
00:11:40 --> 00:11:46
And they have a certain
velocity to them.

184
00:11:43 --> 00:11:49
Now what do I do if I follow
this plan of eliminating t?

185
00:11:48 --> 00:11:54
Well, if I eliminate t directly
from the system,

186
00:11:52 --> 00:11:58
what will I get?
I will get dy by dx.

187
00:11:55 --> 00:12:01
I divide this equation by that
one.

188
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
-- is equal to negative x over.

189
00:12:03 --> 00:12:09
Oh, well, of course,
that is solvable.

190
00:12:06 --> 00:12:12
You were able to solve by 18.01
methods before you ever come

191
00:12:11 --> 00:12:17
into this course.
By separation of variables,

192
00:12:15 --> 00:12:21
it is y dy equals 
negative x dx,

193
00:12:19 --> 00:12:25
which integrates to be one-half
y squared equals negative

194
00:12:24 --> 00:12:30
one-half x squared plus a
constant.

195
00:12:29 --> 00:12:35
And after multiplying through

196
00:12:33 --> 00:12:39
by two and moving things around
it becomes x squared plus y

197
00:12:37 --> 00:12:43
squared.
The nicest way to say it is

198
00:12:41 --> 00:12:47
implicitly, x squared plus y
squared equals some positive

199
00:12:45 --> 00:12:51
constant.
These are the circles.

200
00:12:47 --> 00:12:53
Now, can I eliminate t?
I could also take one of these

201
00:12:51 --> 00:12:57
solutions and eliminate t.
If I square this,

202
00:12:54 --> 00:13:00
the best way to do it is not to
use our cosines and arcsines and

203
00:12:59 --> 00:13:05
whatnot, which will just get you
totally lost.

204
00:13:04 --> 00:13:10
Square this,
square that and add them

205
00:13:06 --> 00:13:12
together.
And you conclude that x squared

206
00:13:09 --> 00:13:15
plus y squared is equal to one.

207
00:13:13 --> 00:13:19
Or, if c1 is not one it is
equal to c1 squared.

208
00:13:16 --> 00:13:22
You could eliminate t from the
solution the way you eliminate t

209
00:13:21 --> 00:13:27
from a pair of parametric
equations, and you get it the

210
00:13:25 --> 00:13:31
same way that x squared plus y
squared, in this case,

211
00:13:29 --> 00:13:35
would be c1 squared, I guess.

212
00:13:34 --> 00:13:40

213
00:13:39 --> 00:13:45
In some sense,
what we are doing is cycling

214
00:13:42 --> 00:13:48
around to the beginning of the
term.

215
00:13:44 --> 00:13:50
In fact, this whole lecture,
as you will see,

216
00:13:48 --> 00:13:54
is about cycles of one sort or
another.

217
00:13:51 --> 00:13:57
But I keep thinking of that
great line of poetry,

218
00:13:54 --> 00:14:00
"in my end is my beginning" or
maybe it's "in my beginning is

219
00:13:59 --> 00:14:05
my end".
I think both lines occur.

220
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
But that is what is happening
here.

221
00:14:05 --> 00:14:11
This is the beginning of the
course and this is the end of

222
00:14:08 --> 00:14:14
the course, and they have this
almost trivial relation between

223
00:14:12 --> 00:14:18
them.
But notice the totally

224
00:14:14 --> 00:14:20
different methods used for
analyzing this,

225
00:14:17 --> 00:14:23
where the t is included,
than from analyzing this where

226
00:14:20 --> 00:14:26
there is no t.
The goals are different,

227
00:14:22 --> 00:14:28
what you look for are
different, everything is

228
00:14:25 --> 00:14:31
different, and yet it is almost
the same problem.

229
00:14:30 --> 00:14:36
I promised you a nonlinear
example.

230
00:14:33 --> 00:14:39
I guess it is time to see what
that is.

231
00:14:37 --> 00:14:43

232
00:14:44 --> 00:14:50
It is going to be another
predator-prey equation,

233
00:14:47 --> 00:14:53
but one which is,
in some ways,

234
00:14:49 --> 00:14:55
simpler than the one I gave you
for homework.

235
00:14:52 --> 00:14:58
The predator is going to be x
because you are used to that

236
00:14:56 --> 00:15:02
from the robins.
I am keeping the same

237
00:14:59 --> 00:15:05
predator-prey variables.
And the prey will be y.

238
00:15:03 --> 00:15:09
And now just notice the small
difference from what I gave you

239
00:15:08 --> 00:15:14
before.
For one thing,

240
00:15:09 --> 00:15:15
I am not giving you specific
numbers.

241
00:15:12 --> 00:15:18
I am going to,
at the beginning at least,

242
00:15:15 --> 00:15:21
do some of the analysis at the
beginning using letters,

243
00:15:19 --> 00:15:25
using parameters.
a, b, c, d are always going to

244
00:15:22 --> 00:15:28
be positive constants.
I am going to assume that x

245
00:15:26 --> 00:15:32
prime equals minus ax.

246
00:15:30 --> 00:15:36
This represents the predator
dying out if there is no prey

247
00:15:36 --> 00:15:42
there, but if there is something
to eat that term represents the

248
00:15:43 --> 00:15:49
predator meeting up with the
prey and gobbling it up.

249
00:15:48 --> 00:15:54
And b is the coefficient.
How about without predictors,

250
00:15:54 --> 00:16:00
the prey will multiply and be
fruitful.

251
00:16:00 --> 00:16:06
Unfortunately they get eaten,
and so there will be a term

252
00:16:04 --> 00:16:10
that looks like this.
Now, there are two basic

253
00:16:07 --> 00:16:13
differences between these simple
equations and the slightly more

254
00:16:12 --> 00:16:18
complicated ones you had with
the robin-earthworm equations.

255
00:16:16 --> 00:16:22
Namely, in the first place,
I am assuming that these guys,

256
00:16:20 --> 00:16:26
let's give them names.
I want you to remember which is

257
00:16:24 --> 00:16:30
x and which is y,
so we are going to think of

258
00:16:27 --> 00:16:33
these are "sharx".
[LAUGHTER]

259
00:16:31 --> 00:16:37
And these will be food fish,
so let's make them "yumfish".

260
00:16:38 --> 00:16:44

261
00:16:50 --> 00:16:56
The fact that with your robins
you had a positive term here.

262
00:16:54 --> 00:17:00
I made this 2x.
And now it is minus a times x.

263
00:16:57 --> 00:17:03
What is the difference?
The difference is that robins

264
00:17:02 --> 00:17:08
have other things to eat,
so even if there are not any

265
00:17:06 --> 00:17:12
worms, a robin will survive.
It could eat other insects,

266
00:17:10 --> 00:17:16
grubs, Japanese beetle grubs.
I think it can even eat seeds.

267
00:17:15 --> 00:17:21
Anyway, the robins in my garden
seem to be pecking at things

268
00:17:20 --> 00:17:26
that don't seem to be insects.
And the other is that I am

269
00:17:24 --> 00:17:30
assuming a very naīve growth
law.

270
00:17:27 --> 00:17:33
For example,
if there are no sharks,

271
00:17:30 --> 00:17:36
how are the food fish fruitful
and multiplying?

272
00:17:35 --> 00:17:41
They multiple exponentially.
Now, obviously you cannot have

273
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
unlimited growth like that.
With the worms we added the

274
00:17:43 --> 00:17:49
term minus a constant times y
squared to indicate that even

275
00:17:48 --> 00:17:54
worms cannot multiply purely
exponentially forever,

276
00:17:51 --> 00:17:57
but ultimately their growth
levels off because they cannot

277
00:17:56 --> 00:18:02
find enough organic matter to
plow their way through.

278
00:18:01 --> 00:18:07
Those are the two differences.
I am not assuming a logistic

279
00:18:05 --> 00:18:11
growth law.
This is less sophisticated than

280
00:18:08 --> 00:18:14
the one I gave you for homework.
This assumes that sharks have

281
00:18:12 --> 00:18:18
absolutely nothing to eat except
these fish, which is not so bad.

282
00:18:17 --> 00:18:23
That's true,
more or less.

283
00:18:20 --> 00:18:26

284
00:18:25 --> 00:18:31
My plan is now,
with this model,

285
00:18:27 --> 00:18:33
let's start the analysis,
as you learned to do it.

286
00:18:30 --> 00:18:36
And we are going to run into
trouble at various places.

287
00:18:34 --> 00:18:40
And the troubles will then
illustrate these three points

288
00:18:38 --> 00:18:44
that I wanted to add to your
repertoire of things to do with

289
00:18:43 --> 00:18:49
nonlinear systems when you run
into trouble.

290
00:18:47 --> 00:18:53
And it will also increase your
understanding of the nonlinear

291
00:18:50 --> 00:18:56
systems.
The first thing we have to do

292
00:18:52 --> 00:18:58
is find the critical points.
I am going to assume that you

293
00:18:56 --> 00:19:02
are good at this and,
therefore, not spend a lot of

294
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
time detailing the calculations.
I will simply write them on the

295
00:19:04 --> 00:19:10
board.
The first equation I am going

296
00:19:06 --> 00:19:12
to write down is x times minus a
plus by equals zero.

297
00:19:11 --> 00:19:17
And I assume you know why I am

298
00:19:13 --> 00:19:19
writing that down.
And the other equation will be

299
00:19:17 --> 00:19:23
y times c minus dx is zero.

300
00:19:20 --> 00:19:26
Those are the simultaneous
equations I have to find to find

301
00:19:24 --> 00:19:30
the critical point.
The first one is if the product

302
00:19:30 --> 00:19:36
of these is zero,
either x is zero or the other

303
00:19:34 --> 00:19:40
factor is.
So, from the second equation,

304
00:19:38 --> 00:19:44
if x is zero,
y has to be zero also.

305
00:19:42 --> 00:19:48
That is one critical point.
Now, if x is not zero then this

306
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
factor has to be zero which says
that y must be equal 

307
00:19:54 --> 00:20:00
to a over b.
And if y is equal to a over b,

308
00:19:59 --> 00:20:05
it is not zero here.
Therefore, this factor must be

309
00:20:02 --> 00:20:08
zero which says that x is equal
to c over d.

310
00:20:06 --> 00:20:12
You see right away that this
must be a simpler system because

311
00:20:10 --> 00:20:16
it is only producing two
critical points.

312
00:20:12 --> 00:20:18
Whereas, the system that you
did for homework had four.

313
00:20:16 --> 00:20:22
Here is one.
Well, let's just write them up

314
00:20:19 --> 00:20:25
here.
The critical points are zero,

315
00:20:21 --> 00:20:27
zero.
That doesn't look terribly

316
00:20:23 --> 00:20:29
interesting, but the other one
looks more interesting.

317
00:20:27 --> 00:20:33
It is c over d,
a over b.

318
00:20:31 --> 00:20:37
Well, let's take a look first
at the zero, zero critical

319
00:20:34 --> 00:20:40
point.
The origin, in other words.

320
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
What does that look like?

321
00:20:39 --> 00:20:45

322
00:20:44 --> 00:20:50
Well, at the origin,
the linearization is extremely

323
00:20:47 --> 00:20:53
easy to do because I simply
ignore the quadratic terms,

324
00:20:51 --> 00:20:57
which are the product of two
small numbers,

325
00:20:55 --> 00:21:01
where these only have a single
small number in it.

326
00:20:58 --> 00:21:04
It is minus ax,
cy.

327
00:21:01 --> 00:21:07
In other words,
the linearization matrix is

328
00:21:03 --> 00:21:09
minus a, zero,
zero and cy gives me a

329
00:21:06 --> 00:21:12
coefficient c there.

330
00:21:08 --> 00:21:14
Now, I don't think at any point
I have ever explicitly told you

331
00:21:12 --> 00:21:18
that I hope you have learned
from the homework or maybe your

332
00:21:16 --> 00:21:22
recitation teacher,
but for heaven's sake,

333
00:21:19 --> 00:21:25
put this down in your little
books, if you have a diagonal

334
00:21:23 --> 00:21:29
matrix, for god's sake,
don't calculate its

335
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
eigenvalues.
They are right in front of you.

336
00:21:30 --> 00:21:36
They are always the diagonal
elements.

337
00:21:32 --> 00:21:38
The eigenvalue,
you can check this out if you

338
00:21:35 --> 00:21:41
insist on writing the equation,
but trust me it is clear.

339
00:21:40 --> 00:21:46
If I, for example,
subtract c from the main

340
00:21:43 --> 00:21:49
diagonal, I am going to get a
determinant zero because the

341
00:21:47 --> 00:21:53
bottom row will be all zero.
The eigenvalues are negative a

342
00:21:51 --> 00:21:57
and c.
In other words,

343
00:21:53 --> 00:21:59
they have opposite signs.
This is a negative number.

344
00:21:56 --> 00:22:02
That is a positive number --
-- because a,

345
00:22:00 --> 00:22:06
b, c and d are always positive.
And, therefore,

346
00:22:03 --> 00:22:09
this is automatically a saddle.
You don't have to calculate

347
00:22:07 --> 00:22:13
anything.
It is all right in front of

348
00:22:09 --> 00:22:15
you.
It must be a saddle and,

349
00:22:11 --> 00:22:17
therefore, unstable because all
saddles are.

350
00:22:13 --> 00:22:19
And, in fact,
you can even draw the little

351
00:22:16 --> 00:22:22
picture of what the stuff looks
like near the origin without

352
00:22:19 --> 00:22:25
even bothering to calculate
eigenvectors,

353
00:22:22 --> 00:22:28
although it is extremely easy
to do.

354
00:22:24 --> 00:22:30
Just from common sense,
these are the sharks and these

355
00:22:27 --> 00:22:33
are the yumfish.
Well, if there are zero

356
00:22:31 --> 00:22:37
yumfish, in other words,
if I am on the sharks axis,

357
00:22:35 --> 00:22:41
the axis of sharks,
I die out.

358
00:22:38 --> 00:22:44
Well, forget about this side.
It's on the positive side.

359
00:22:42 --> 00:22:48
That makes sense.
But I die out because the

360
00:22:45 --> 00:22:51
sharks have nothing to eat.
Whereas, if I am on the yumfish

361
00:22:50 --> 00:22:56
axis I go this way.
I grow because,

362
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
without any sharks to eat them,
the yumfish increase.

363
00:22:56 --> 00:23:02
So it must look like that.
And, therefore,

364
00:23:00 --> 00:23:06
the saddle must look like this.
The saddle curves hug those and

365
00:23:04 --> 00:23:10
go nearby.
Now, the other critical point

366
00:23:07 --> 00:23:13
is the interesting one.
And for that the analysis,

367
00:23:10 --> 00:23:16
in order that you don't spend
the rest of this period writing

368
00:23:14 --> 00:23:20
a's, b's, c's and d's,
I am going to make the

369
00:23:17 --> 00:23:23
simplifying assumption.
But it doesn't change

370
00:23:20 --> 00:23:26
qualitatively any of the
mathematics.

371
00:23:22 --> 00:23:28
It just makes it a little
easier to write everything out.

372
00:23:26 --> 00:23:32
I am going to assume that
everything is one.

373
00:23:30 --> 00:23:36
Well, in fact,
even this would be good enough,

374
00:23:33 --> 00:23:39
but let's make everything one.
I am going to assume this.

375
00:23:37 --> 00:23:43
And it is only to make the
writing simpler.

376
00:23:40 --> 00:23:46
It doesn't really change the
mathematics at all.

377
00:23:44 --> 00:23:50
Well, if everything is one,
in order to calculate the

378
00:23:47 --> 00:23:53
linearized system,
I'd better use the Jacobian.

379
00:23:51 --> 00:23:57
But perhaps it would be better
to write out explicitly what the

380
00:23:56 --> 00:24:02
system is.
The system now is x prime

381
00:23:58 --> 00:24:04
equals minus x plus xy,
all the coefficients are

382
00:24:03 --> 00:24:09
one.
And y prime is equal to y minus

383
00:24:07 --> 00:24:13
xy.
What is the Jacobian?

384
00:24:10 --> 00:24:16
Well, the Jacobian is the
partial of this with respect to

385
00:24:14 --> 00:24:20
x which is minus one plus y,
the partial with respect

386
00:24:19 --> 00:24:25
to y which is x,
the partial of this with

387
00:24:22 --> 00:24:28
respect to x,
which is minus y,

388
00:24:24 --> 00:24:30
and the partial with respect to
y, which is one minus x.

389
00:24:28 --> 00:24:34
But I want to evaluate that at

390
00:24:32 --> 00:24:38
the point one, one,

391
00:24:35 --> 00:24:41
which is the critical point.
It is the critical point

392
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
because I have assumed that all
these parameters have the value

393
00:24:46 --> 00:24:52
one.
And when I do that,

394
00:24:48 --> 00:24:54
evaluating it at one, one,

395
00:24:51 --> 00:24:57
I get what matrix?
Well, I get zero,

396
00:24:54 --> 00:25:00
one, negative one,
zero.

397
00:24:57 --> 00:25:03
In other words,

398
00:25:01 --> 00:25:07
the linearized system is x
prime equals y and y

399
00:25:07 --> 00:25:13
prime equals negative x.

400
00:25:11 --> 00:25:17
Well, that is just the one we
analyzed before in terms of --

401
00:25:18 --> 00:25:24

402
00:25:23 --> 00:25:29
It's the one whose solutions
are circles.

403
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
In other words,
what we find out is that the

404
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34
linearized system is what
geometric type?

405
00:25:32 --> 00:25:38
Saddle?
Node?

406
00:25:34 --> 00:25:40
Spiral?
None of those.

407
00:25:37 --> 00:25:43
It is a center.
The linearized system is a

408
00:25:44 --> 00:25:50
center.

409
00:25:47 --> 00:25:53

410
00:25:52 --> 00:25:58
It consists,
in other words,

411
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
of a bunch of curves going
round and round next to each

412
00:25:58 --> 00:26:04
other.
Concentric circles,

413
00:25:59 --> 00:26:05
in fact.
Well, what is wrong with that?

414
00:26:03 --> 00:26:09
Now, we are in deep trouble.
We are now in trouble because

415
00:26:07 --> 00:26:13
that is a borderline case.
Let me remind you of what the

416
00:26:12 --> 00:26:18
borderline cases are.
When we drew that picture,

417
00:26:15 --> 00:26:21
this is from last week's
problem set so you have a

418
00:26:19 --> 00:26:25
perfect excuse for forgetting it
totally.

419
00:26:22 --> 00:26:28
But I am trying to remind you
of it.

420
00:26:25 --> 00:26:31
That is another reason why I am
doing this.

421
00:26:30 --> 00:26:36
Remember that picture I asked
you about that appeared on the

422
00:26:34 --> 00:26:40
computer screen?
Let's make it a little flatter

423
00:26:38 --> 00:26:44
so that I can have room to write
in.

424
00:26:40 --> 00:26:46
This is a certain parabola
whose equation you are dying to

425
00:26:45 --> 00:26:51
tell me, but I am not asking.
There is the trace,

426
00:26:48 --> 00:26:54
this is the determinant,
and the characteristic equation

427
00:26:53 --> 00:26:59
is related to the values of
these numbers like plus d equals

428
00:26:57 --> 00:27:03
zero.
Then these were spiral synchs.

429
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
This was the region of spiral
sources.

430
00:27:07 --> 00:27:13
That is the abbreviation for
sources.

431
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
These were nodal synchs and
these were the nodal sources.

432
00:27:18 --> 00:27:24
And down here were the saddles.
And where were the centers?

433
00:27:24 --> 00:27:30
The centers were along this
line.

434
00:27:30 --> 00:27:36
The centers,
there weren't many of them,

435
00:27:32 --> 00:27:38
and they were the separation
for these two regions.

436
00:27:36 --> 00:27:42
I will put that down.
These are the centers.

437
00:27:39 --> 00:27:45
These other borderlines
correspond to other things.

438
00:27:42 --> 00:27:48
These are defective
eigenvalues, zero eigenvalues

439
00:27:45 --> 00:27:51
and so on.
But let's concentrate on just

440
00:27:48 --> 00:27:54
one of them.
You will find the others

441
00:27:50 --> 00:27:56
discussed in the notes,
GS7.

442
00:27:52 --> 00:27:58
But if you get this idea then
the rest is just details.

443
00:27:56 --> 00:28:02
I think it will be perfectly
clear.

444
00:28:00 --> 00:28:06
What is wrong with the center?
The answer is that if we are on

445
00:28:04 --> 00:28:10
the center, for example,
this system corresponds to the

446
00:28:08 --> 00:28:14
trace being zero and the
determinant being plus one.

447
00:28:12 --> 00:28:18
It corresponds to t equals zero
and d equals one.

448
00:28:16 --> 00:28:22
This point, in other words.
Now, if I wiggle the

449
00:28:19 --> 00:28:25
coefficients of the matrix just
a little bit,

450
00:28:23 --> 00:28:29
just change them a little bit,
what I am going to do is move

451
00:28:27 --> 00:28:33
off this pink line.
And I might move to here or I

452
00:28:31 --> 00:28:37
might move a little way to
there.

453
00:28:34 --> 00:28:40
But, if I do that,
I change the geometric type.

454
00:28:37 --> 00:28:43
In other words,
being a borderline,

455
00:28:39 --> 00:28:45
a slight change of the
parameters can change what it

456
00:28:42 --> 00:28:48
changes to.
And, in fact,

457
00:28:44 --> 00:28:50
that is geometrically clear.
What does a center look like?

458
00:28:48 --> 00:28:54
A center looks like this,
a bunch of curves going around

459
00:28:51 --> 00:28:57
all in the same direction,
like concentric circles or

460
00:28:55 --> 00:29:01
maybe ellipses or something like
that.

461
00:28:59 --> 00:29:05
If I deform the picture just a
little bit, well,

462
00:29:03 --> 00:29:09
I might change it into
something that looks like this

463
00:29:07 --> 00:29:13
where, after they go around they
don't quite meet up with where

464
00:29:12 --> 00:29:18
they were to start with.
And I am going to get a spiral

465
00:29:17 --> 00:29:23
synch.
Or, I might do the deformation

466
00:29:20 --> 00:29:26
by going around once and I'm a
little outside of where I was.

467
00:29:25 --> 00:29:31
In which case it's going to be
a spiral source.

468
00:29:31 --> 00:29:37
The fact that just changing
these curves a little bit can

469
00:29:35 --> 00:29:41
change the picture to this or to
that corresponds to the fact

470
00:29:39 --> 00:29:45
that if you are on here with
this value of t and d,

471
00:29:43 --> 00:29:49
zero and one,
and just change t and d a

472
00:29:46 --> 00:29:52
little bit, you are going to
move off into these regions.

473
00:29:51 --> 00:29:57
You might, of course,
stay on the pink line.

474
00:29:54 --> 00:30:00
It is not very likely.
Where does this leave us?

475
00:29:59 --> 00:30:05
Well, if the linear system is
not stable in the sense that if

476
00:30:02 --> 00:30:08
you change the parameters a
little bit it doesn't change the

477
00:30:06 --> 00:30:12
type.
This is, after all,

478
00:30:07 --> 00:30:13
only an approximation to the
nonlinear system.

479
00:30:10 --> 00:30:16
If in this approximation you
cannot really predict the

480
00:30:13 --> 00:30:19
behavior of very well when you
change the parameters,

481
00:30:17 --> 00:30:23
then from it you cannot tell
what the original system looked

482
00:30:20 --> 00:30:26
like.
In other words,

483
00:30:23 --> 00:30:29
the nonlinear system at one,
one might be any one

484
00:30:28 --> 00:30:34
of the possibilities,
still a center or it might be a

485
00:30:32 --> 00:30:38
spiral synch or it might be a
spiral source.

486
00:30:36 --> 00:30:42
Any one of those three is a
possibility.

487
00:30:39 --> 00:30:45
It couldn't be a saddle because
that is too far away.

488
00:30:44 --> 00:30:50
It couldn't be a node.
That is too far away,

489
00:30:48 --> 00:30:54
too.
But it could wander into either

490
00:30:51 --> 00:30:57
of these regions and,
therefore, the picture you

491
00:30:55 --> 00:31:01
cannot tell which of these three
it is just from this type of

492
00:31:00 --> 00:31:06
critical point analysis.
Well, that was Volterra's

493
00:31:06 --> 00:31:12
problem.
By the way, the person who

494
00:31:08 --> 00:31:14
introduced these equations and
studied them systematically in

495
00:31:13 --> 00:31:19
the way in which we are doing it
here was Volterra.

496
00:31:17 --> 00:31:23
And, in fact,
he was interested in sharks and

497
00:31:21 --> 00:31:27
food fish, as they were called.
What do we do?

498
00:31:24 --> 00:31:30
Well, you have to be smart.
What Volterra did was he went

499
00:31:29 --> 00:31:35
to method number one.
Let's do it.

500
00:31:33 --> 00:31:39

501
00:31:38 --> 00:31:44
Volterra said I got my
equations x prime equals minus x

502
00:31:45 --> 00:31:51
plus xy.
y prime is equal to,

503
00:31:51 --> 00:31:57
these are the food fish,
y minus xy.

504
00:31:58 --> 00:32:04
Let's eliminate t.
And my problem is,

505
00:32:03 --> 00:32:09
of course, I am trying to
determine what type of critical

506
00:32:07 --> 00:32:13
point one, one is.
And the method we have used up

507
00:32:11 --> 00:32:17
until now has failed because it
gave us a borderline case,

508
00:32:16 --> 00:32:22
which is from that we cannot
deduce.

509
00:32:19 --> 00:32:25
He said let's eliminate t.
And we get dy over dx

510
00:32:23 --> 00:32:29
equals, I am going to factor,
y times one minus x on top.

511
00:32:29 --> 00:32:35
And on the bottom factor x
negative one plus y.

512
00:32:34 --> 00:32:40
You could solve that before you
came into 18.03,

513
00:32:39 --> 00:32:45
right?
This you can separate

514
00:32:42 --> 00:32:48
variables.
Let's separate variables.

515
00:32:46 --> 00:32:52
The y's all go on one side,
so y goes down here.

516
00:32:52 --> 00:32:58
It is (y minus one) over y dy
equals --

517
00:33:00 --> 00:33:06
On the other side the dx gets
moved up, one minus x over x dx.

518
00:33:03 --> 00:33:09
Now, of course,
you wouldn't dream of using

519
00:33:06 --> 00:33:12
partial fractions on this.
It would be illegal because,

520
00:33:09 --> 00:33:15
even though it is a rational
function, the quotient of two

521
00:33:13 --> 00:33:19
polynomials, the degree of the
top is not smaller than the

522
00:33:16 --> 00:33:22
degree of the bottom.
In other words,

523
00:33:18 --> 00:33:24
it is a partial fraction so
this degree must be bigger than

524
00:33:22 --> 00:33:28
that one.
And it isn't so you would have

525
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
to first divide.
And if you divide by that then

526
00:33:27 --> 00:33:33
there is no point in using
partial fractions at all.

527
00:33:32 --> 00:33:38

528
00:33:37 --> 00:33:43
Of course, you would have done
this by basic instant,

529
00:33:41 --> 00:33:47
I know.
What is the solution?

530
00:33:43 --> 00:33:49
It is y minus log y equals log
x minus x plus some constant.

531
00:33:49 --> 00:33:55
That is not the final constant

532
00:33:53 --> 00:33:59
I want so I will give it a
subscript one to indicate I want

533
00:33:58 --> 00:34:04
more.
This is very hard to see what

534
00:34:02 --> 00:34:08
that curve looks like.
We can make it look better by

535
00:34:05 --> 00:34:11
exponentiating.
If I exponentiate it,

536
00:34:08 --> 00:34:14
going back to high school
mathematics, but I know from

537
00:34:11 --> 00:34:17
experience that many of you are
not too good at this step,

538
00:34:16 --> 00:34:22
so that is another reason I am
doing it, it will be 

539
00:34:20 --> 00:34:26
e to the y, times,
that part is easy because

540
00:34:23 --> 00:34:29
pluses and minuses change into
times, times e to the negative

541
00:34:27 --> 00:34:33
log y.
Well, e to the log y is y.

542
00:34:31 --> 00:34:37
If I put a minus sign in front

543
00:34:35 --> 00:34:41
of that, that sends it into the
denominator, so instead of being

544
00:34:40 --> 00:34:46
y it is one over y 
Equals x, e to log x is x,

545
00:34:44 --> 00:34:50
e to the negative x

546
00:34:48 --> 00:34:54
is, therefore,
times one over e to the x.

547
00:34:51 --> 00:34:57
And that is times the

548
00:34:53 --> 00:34:59
exponential of c1,
which I will call c2.

549
00:34:58 --> 00:35:04
And now if I combine them all
and put them all on one side it

550
00:35:04 --> 00:35:10
is x over e to the x times y
over e to the y is equal to yet

551
00:35:10 --> 00:35:16
another constant,
one over c2.

552
00:35:14 --> 00:35:20
This is my final constant so

553
00:35:18 --> 00:35:24
let's call that c.
In other words,

554
00:35:21 --> 00:35:27
the integral curves are the
graphs of this equation for

555
00:35:27 --> 00:35:33
different values of the constant
c.

556
00:35:32 --> 00:35:38
Well, of course you've graphed
an equation like that all the

557
00:35:37 --> 00:35:43
time.
What am I going to do with this

558
00:35:41 --> 00:35:47
stupid thing?
Well, I deliberately picked

559
00:35:44 --> 00:35:50
something which involved all
your learning up until now.

560
00:35:50 --> 00:35:56
We are now going into 18.02,
right?

561
00:35:53 --> 00:35:59
You looked at that in 18.02 you
would say this is the contour

562
00:35:59 --> 00:36:05
curve, these are contour curves
of the function --

563
00:36:05 --> 00:36:11
Well, let's write it out the
other way.

564
00:36:07 --> 00:36:13
It doesn't make any difference,
but you are more likely to have

565
00:36:10 --> 00:36:16
seen the function in this form.
x over e to the x

566
00:36:13 --> 00:36:19
you won't recognize,
but this you will.

567
00:36:15 --> 00:36:21
In fact, we have had it before
this term.

568
00:36:18 --> 00:36:24
It is one of the kinds of
solutions you can add to second

569
00:36:21 --> 00:36:27
order equations.
Times y e to the negative y

570
00:36:23 --> 00:36:29
equals c.
It is the contour curves of

571
00:36:26 --> 00:36:32
this function.
Let's call that function,

572
00:36:29 --> 00:36:35
let's say, h of (x,y).

573
00:36:32 --> 00:36:38
Well, of course you could throw
it on Matlab,

574
00:36:35 --> 00:36:41
as you did in 18.02 maybe,
and ask Matlab to plot the

575
00:36:39 --> 00:36:45
function.
But Volterra didn't have that

576
00:36:42 --> 00:36:48
luxury.
He was smart,

577
00:36:43 --> 00:36:49
too.
So let's be smart instead.

578
00:36:47 --> 00:36:53

579
00:36:53 --> 00:36:59
What is the function x?
Let's use a neutral variable

580
00:36:56 --> 00:37:02
like u and plot u e to the
negative u.

581
00:37:00 --> 00:37:06
18.01.
At zero, it has the value zero.

582
00:37:03 --> 00:37:09
When u is small this has
approximately the value one and,

583
00:37:08 --> 00:37:14
therefore, it starts out like
the function u.

584
00:37:12 --> 00:37:18
As u goes to infinity,
you know by L'Hopital's rule

585
00:37:16 --> 00:37:22
that this goes to zero so it
ends up like this.

586
00:37:20 --> 00:37:26
Well, what on earth could it
possibly do except rise to a

587
00:37:25 --> 00:37:31
maximum?
But where is that maximum?

588
00:37:30 --> 00:37:36
It is easy to see there is a
unique maximum just by 18.01.

589
00:37:34 --> 00:37:40
Take the derivative,
find out where the maximum

590
00:37:37 --> 00:37:43
point is and you will find,
perhaps you have already done

591
00:37:41 --> 00:37:47
it, this is at one.
The maximum occurs at one,

592
00:37:44 --> 00:37:50
that is where the derivative is
zero and the value there is one

593
00:37:49 --> 00:37:55
times e to the minus one.

594
00:37:52 --> 00:37:58
It is one over e,
in other words.

595
00:37:55 --> 00:38:01
That is what the curve looks
like.

596
00:37:57 --> 00:38:03
What do the contour curves of
this look like?

597
00:38:02 --> 00:38:08
Well, if we are looking at the
contour curves of the function

598
00:38:07 --> 00:38:13
h, so here is x,
here is y, and we want the

599
00:38:11 --> 00:38:17
contour curves of the function h
of (x, y),

600
00:38:16 --> 00:38:22
 what do I know?
Where is its maximum?

601
00:38:20 --> 00:38:26
The maximum point of h of x,
y is where?

602
00:38:24 --> 00:38:30
Well, h is the product x e to
the negative x times y e to the

603
00:38:30 --> 00:38:36
minus y.

604
00:38:35 --> 00:38:41
This has its maximum at one,
this has its maximum at one,

605
00:38:39 --> 00:38:45
so where does h of (x,
y) head?

606
00:38:43 --> 00:38:49
Well, you have two factors.
One makes each of them the

607
00:38:48 --> 00:38:54
biggest they can be.
The maximum must be exactly at

608
00:38:52 --> 00:38:58
that critical point one,
one.

609
00:38:55 --> 00:39:01
That is our maximum point.
Let's make it conspicuous.

610
00:39:01 --> 00:39:07
This is the maximum point.
It is the point one,

611
00:39:05 --> 00:39:11
one.
It is the point that makes the

612
00:39:09 --> 00:39:15
function biggest.
Now, how about the contour

613
00:39:13 --> 00:39:19
curves?
Well, this is the top of the

614
00:39:16 --> 00:39:22
mountain.
What is it along the axes?

615
00:39:19 --> 00:39:25
Along the axes,
when either x or y is zero,

616
00:39:23 --> 00:39:29
the function has the value
zero, so it is biggest there.

617
00:39:28 --> 00:39:34
It has the value zero here.
So it is zero value.

618
00:39:33 --> 00:39:39
What are the contour curves?
Well, we must have a mountain

619
00:39:38 --> 00:39:44
peak here.
This is the unique maximum

620
00:39:41 --> 00:39:47
point.
In fact, it is easy to see the

621
00:39:44 --> 00:39:50
contour curves just surround it
like that.

622
00:39:47 --> 00:39:53
Now, the reason they cannot be
spirals, well,

623
00:39:51 --> 00:39:57
in the first place,
you never see contour curves

624
00:39:55 --> 00:40:01
that were spirals.
That is a good reason.

625
00:40:00 --> 00:40:06
It is a mountain.
That is the way contour curves

626
00:40:03 --> 00:40:09
of a mountain look.
But, all right,

627
00:40:06 --> 00:40:12
that is not a good argument.
But notice that along each

628
00:40:10 --> 00:40:16
horizontal line here,
I want to know how many times

629
00:40:14 --> 00:40:20
can it intersect the contour
curve?

630
00:40:16 --> 00:40:22
That is the same as asking
along one of these lines how

631
00:40:20 --> 00:40:26
many times could it intersect?
See, this is a graph of the

632
00:40:25 --> 00:40:31
function along this horizontal
line.

633
00:40:29 --> 00:40:35
And, therefore,
how many times can it intersect

634
00:40:32 --> 00:40:38
one of the contour curves the
same number of times that a

635
00:40:36 --> 00:40:42
horizontal line can intersect
this curve?

636
00:40:39 --> 00:40:45
Twice.
Only once if you are exactly at

637
00:40:42 --> 00:40:48
that height and after that
never.

638
00:40:44 --> 00:40:50
But here it can intersect each
contour curve only twice which

639
00:40:48 --> 00:40:54
means these things cannot be
spirals.

640
00:40:51 --> 00:40:57
Otherwise, they would intersect
those horizontal and vertical

641
00:40:55 --> 00:41:01
lines many times instead of just
twice.

642
00:41:00 --> 00:41:06
That is what it looks like.
In fact, we can even put in the

643
00:41:04 --> 00:41:10
direction without any effort.
We know that the sharks die out

644
00:41:09 --> 00:41:15
without any food fish and the
food fish grow.

645
00:41:13 --> 00:41:19
Well, I think this has to be
clockwise.

646
00:41:16 --> 00:41:22
Of course, the guys nearby must
be going the same way.

647
00:41:21 --> 00:41:27
And, therefore,
the guys near them must be

648
00:41:24 --> 00:41:30
going the same way.
And it is sort of a domino

649
00:41:28 --> 00:41:34
effect.
The direction spreads and there

650
00:41:32 --> 00:41:38
is only one compatible way of
making these.

651
00:41:35 --> 00:41:41
They all must be going
clockwise.

652
00:41:37 --> 00:41:43
What is happening,
actually?

653
00:41:39 --> 00:41:45
At this point there are a lot
of sharks but not so many food

654
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
fish.
The sharks eat the few

655
00:41:46 --> 00:41:52
remaining food fish,
and now the sharks start to die

656
00:41:49 --> 00:41:55
out because they have nothing to
eat.

657
00:41:52 --> 00:41:58
When they are practically gone,
the food fish can start growing

658
00:41:56 --> 00:42:02
again and grow and grow.
For a while they grow happily,

659
00:42:02 --> 00:42:08
and then the sharks suddenly
start being able to find them

660
00:42:06 --> 00:42:12
again.
And the few remaining sharks

661
00:42:09 --> 00:42:15
start eating them,
the population of sharks grows,

662
00:42:13 --> 00:42:19
the food fish start dying out
again, and the cycle starts all

663
00:42:18 --> 00:42:24
over again.
Now, I wanted to talk about the

664
00:42:21 --> 00:42:27
qualitative behavior.
This is, in some ways,

665
00:42:24 --> 00:42:30
the most important part of the
lecture.

666
00:42:29 --> 00:42:35
I wanted to discuss,
just as we did at the beginning

667
00:42:35 --> 00:42:41
of the term, the effect of
fishing with nets at a constant

668
00:42:43 --> 00:42:49
rate k.

669
00:42:45 --> 00:42:51

670
00:42:51 --> 00:42:57
Just as near the beginning of
the term, we talked about

671
00:42:54 --> 00:43:00
fishing a single population.
The only difference is,

672
00:42:57 --> 00:43:03
now there are two populations.
Both sharks and the food fish.

673
00:43:02 --> 00:43:08
Now, what happens to the
equations?

674
00:43:05 --> 00:43:11
Well, the equations start out
just as they were.

675
00:43:10 --> 00:43:16
I am now reverting to a and b.
You will see why.

676
00:43:14 --> 00:43:20
It's because we need the
general coefficients.

677
00:43:18 --> 00:43:24
Plus bxy.
But, if we are fishing with

678
00:43:21 --> 00:43:27
nets, then a certain fraction of
the sharks in the sea get hauled

679
00:43:27 --> 00:43:33
in by the net.
And say the fishing rate is k.

680
00:43:32 --> 00:43:38
There is a fishing term.
We remove minus k times a

681
00:43:36 --> 00:43:42
certain fraction of the sharks
in the sea.

682
00:43:40 --> 00:43:46
How about the food fish?
Well, we remove them,

683
00:43:44 --> 00:43:50
too.
And we don't distinguish

684
00:43:47 --> 00:43:53
between sharks and food fish.
This is cy minus dxy.

685
00:43:51 --> 00:43:57
But we also remove a certain

686
00:43:54 --> 00:44:00
fraction of them.
Minus k times y.

687
00:43:58 --> 00:44:04
What, therefore,
is the new system?

688
00:44:03 --> 00:44:09
The new system is therefore x
prime equals minus a plus k.

689
00:44:10 --> 00:44:16
I am combining those two x
terms.

690
00:44:14 --> 00:44:20
That is times x.
Plus bxy.

691
00:44:17 --> 00:44:23
And
the y prime is c minus k times y

692
00:44:24 --> 00:44:30
minus dxy.

693
00:44:30 --> 00:44:36
To solve these,
I do not have to go through the

694
00:44:33 --> 00:44:39
analysis.
All I have to do is change the

695
00:44:37 --> 00:44:43
numbers, change these
coefficients from a to a plus k

696
00:44:41 --> 00:44:47
and c minus k.
The old critical point was the

697
00:44:46 --> 00:44:52
point c over d,
a over b.

698
00:44:49 --> 00:44:55
The new critical point with

699
00:44:52 --> 00:44:58
fishing is what?
Well, the parameters have been

700
00:44:56 --> 00:45:02
changed by the addition of k.
The new critical point is c

701
00:45:02 --> 00:45:08
minus k over d and a plus k over
d.

702
00:45:07 --> 00:45:13
What is the effect of fishing?

703
00:45:11 --> 00:45:17
Well, if the old critical point
was over here,

704
00:45:15 --> 00:45:21
let's say this is the point c
over d and this is the

705
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
point a over b,
that is the old critical point

706
00:45:27 --> 00:45:33
that was over here.
The result of fishing is to

707
00:45:33 --> 00:45:39
lower the value of x and raise
the value here.

708
00:45:38 --> 00:45:44
The new critical point is,
this gets lowered to c minus k

709
00:45:44 --> 00:45:50
over d,
and this gets raised to a plus

710
00:45:50 --> 00:45:56
k over b.
In other words,

711
00:45:54 --> 00:46:00
the new point is there.
The effect of fishing is to --

712
00:46:02 --> 00:46:08
It does not treat the sharks
and the yumfish equally.

713
00:46:07 --> 00:46:13
The effect of fishing lowers
the shark population.

714
00:46:11 --> 00:46:17
See, the critical point gives
sort of the average shark

715
00:46:17 --> 00:46:23
population.
Of course, it cycles around

716
00:46:20 --> 00:46:26
these.
But, on the average,

717
00:46:23 --> 00:46:29
this gives how many sharks
there are and how many food fish

718
00:46:28 --> 00:46:34
there are.
The new critical point with

719
00:46:33 --> 00:46:39
fishing lowers the shark
population and raises the food

720
00:46:39 --> 00:46:45
fish population.
That is not intuitive.

721
00:46:42 --> 00:46:48
And, in fact,
that was observed

722
00:46:45 --> 00:46:51
experimentally at a slightly
different context.

723
00:46:50 --> 00:46:56
And that is why Volterra
started working on the problem.

724
00:46:55 --> 00:47:01
I will need three more minutes.
The most interesting

725
00:47:01 --> 00:47:07
application of all is not to
sharks and food fish.

726
00:47:03 --> 00:47:09
I cannot assume that you are
dramatically interested in how

727
00:47:07 --> 00:47:13
many of them there are in the
ocean, but you might be more

728
00:47:10 --> 00:47:16
interested in this.

729
00:47:12 --> 00:47:18

730
00:47:20 --> 00:47:26
That thing about lowering is
called Volterra's principle.

731
00:47:25 --> 00:47:31
Put that in your books.
Volterra's principle.

732
00:47:29 --> 00:47:35
Volterra is spelt over there.

733
00:47:32 --> 00:47:38

734
00:47:43 --> 00:47:49
-- has found more modern
applications than sharks.

735
00:47:48 --> 00:47:54
Suppose you consider fish in a
pond.

736
00:47:53 --> 00:47:59
You have mosquito larvae which
breed in the pond.

737
00:47:58 --> 00:48:04
This happens.
And then suddenly there is a

738
00:48:03 --> 00:48:09
plague of mosquitoes and
concerned citizens.

739
00:48:07 --> 00:48:13
And this is what happened in
the '50s.

740
00:48:11 --> 00:48:17
That was before you were born,
but not before I was.

741
00:48:16 --> 00:48:22
What happened was a lot of
mosquitoes.

742
00:48:19 --> 00:48:25
Everybody said the mosquitoes
breed in the little stagnant

743
00:48:25 --> 00:48:31
ponds so spray DDT on them.
DDT them.

744
00:48:30 --> 00:48:36
Dump it in the ponds.
That will kill all the larvae

745
00:48:34 --> 00:48:40
and we won't get bitten anymore.
When you put DDT in the pond,

746
00:48:39 --> 00:48:45
as people did not realize at
the time because these things

747
00:48:44 --> 00:48:50
were new, of course you kill the
mosquitoes, but you also kill

748
00:48:49 --> 00:48:55
the fish because DDT is
poisonous to fish.

749
00:48:53 --> 00:48:59
What, in effect,
you are doing mathematically is

750
00:48:57 --> 00:49:03
the same as harvesting the fish
population with the sharks and

751
00:49:02 --> 00:49:08
the food fish.
The result is,

752
00:49:06 --> 00:49:12
the fish are the predators
because they eat the mosquito

753
00:49:11 --> 00:49:17
larvae, big food,
there was a certain

754
00:49:15 --> 00:49:21
equilibrium, according to
Volterra's principle.

755
00:49:20 --> 00:49:26
With DDT that equilibrium moves
to here.

756
00:49:24 --> 00:49:30
In other words,
the effect of indiscriminately

757
00:49:28 --> 00:49:34
spraying the pond with DDT is to
increase the number of

758
00:49:34 --> 00:49:40
mosquitoes and kill fish.
And, in fact,

759
00:49:39 --> 00:49:45
that is exactly what was
observed.

760
00:49:42 --> 00:49:48
The same thing was observed
with the bird population and

761
00:49:48 --> 00:49:54
insects.
Spraying trees for insects to

762
00:49:51 --> 00:49:57
get rid of some pests ends up
killing more birds than it does

763
00:49:58 --> 00:50:04
insects and the insects
increase.

764
00:50:01 --> 00:50:07
Thanks.
