00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,409

2
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:08,320
PROFESSOR: Welcome to
this recitation

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,680
on the phase portrait.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,520
So you're given matrix A, a
two-by-two matrix with entries

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,800
minus 1, minus 1, 1 minus c,
where c is a constant we will

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,770
be varying, and minus 1.

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,280
As c increases from 0 to other
positive values, determine the

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,660
path of the system on the trace
determinant diagram that

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,680
we saw in previous recitations
and draw the phase portraits

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,020
that corresponds to the critical
points and the nature

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,260
of the critical points.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,800
So here, we're basically talking
of a system that would

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,390
be a two-by-two system where we
have derivatives of entry

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,940
xy for vector equals to this
matrix, Ac, multiplying the

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,470
unknown vector xc.

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,330
So take a few minutes and work
out through this problem and

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,580
I'll be right back.

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:06,340

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,150
Welcome back.

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,330
So I already prepared the trace

21
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,860
determined diagram for you.

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,240
So here as a reminder, this is
the parabola that determines

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,640
whether we're going to have
repeated eigenvalues or not.

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,770
Above this parabola, we have
two complex conjugate

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,780
eigenvalues.

26
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,770
Below this parabola, we have
real eigenvalues, either of

27
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,870
the same signs, positive
or negative, or

28
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,680
of different signs.

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,860
And then, we have the
borderline cases.

30
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,740
In our case here, we're looking
in a matrix A with a

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,840
trace equals to minus 1 minus
1, So it's minus 2, and a

32
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,870
determinant that is equal
to 2 minus c.

33
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,250
So here, we are basically along
this dotted line where

34
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,600
the trace equals to minus 2.

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,040
So either we're going to have
complex values with negative

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,810
real parts or negative
eigenvalues.

37
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,900
So we're in stable
configurations.

38
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,980
So we're going to be moving
at c equal to

39
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,419
0 from a case where--

40
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,220

41
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,820
I'm just going to label
this point 1.

42
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,580
For example, we have the matrix,
minus 1, 1, 1, minus 1

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,450
with the trace equals
to minus 2, and the

44
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,990
determinant equals to 2.

45
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,960
So clearly, we are this point.

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,700
And we are just going to be
increasing the value of c and

47
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,150
moving along these lines,
crossing this first boundary

48
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,160
case where we will have either
defective or not case.

49
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,990
And I'll discuss very briefly
what we have.

50
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,640
And then, we have other value
where we are basically in this

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,620
area where we have real
eigenvalues, both of them

52
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,800
negative, so we have
stability.

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,820
And it would basically
be in sync.

54
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,620
And then we cross this other
borderline case where the

55
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,410
determinant is equal to 0.

56
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,670
And here, we have one eigenvalue
that is equal to 0

57
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,020
and one that is negative.

58
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,430
And then, we get to do the part
of the diagram where the

59
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,300
determinant is negative, and
the trace is negative.

60
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,070
And we basically have a saddle
structure where we have one

61
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,740
eigenvalue as negative
and another

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,430
eigenvalue that is positive.

63
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,570
So let's get through
these five cases.

64
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,050
And I'll just do more
detailed picture

65
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,760
illustrating what I just said.

66
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,330
So just write down a bit more in
detail the first case here.

67
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:44,330
So we have the case where the
eigenvalues are both complex

68
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,170
conjugate, and we have their
real part being negative.

69
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:58,290
So basically, we have spirals,
asymptotically stable spirals.

70
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,120
And the spirals could be
either clockwise or

71
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,370
counterclockwise.

72
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:09,510
And one way of determining the
direction of these spirals is

73
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,060
to look at the sign of the
velocity vector of the

74
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,840
trajectory in the face space.

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,970
So the face space basically
diagram here where we have x

76
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,019
and y as the axes
of this space.

77
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:31,430
So let's look, for example, at
a particular point here that

78
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,550
would be velocity vector 1, 0.

79
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,790
And this position vector 1,
0 would give us a velocity

80
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,970
vector of minus 1 and plus 1.

81
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,920
So basically, this vector would
be directed upward,

82
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,520
which means that we are in the
case where we would have a

83
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:56,580
spiral coming this way toward
the critical point and

84
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,500
basically with the velocity
vector here going this way.

85
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,910
You don't have to actually do
all this to figure out which

86
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,680
direction of the spiral
you should choose.

87
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,670
You can just look for these
cases two-by-two matrices at

88
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,400
the entry at the lower left
part of your matrix.

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,970
And if the coefficient here
is positive, then it will

90
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,020
determine the direction of the
velocity vector at this point.

91
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,630
So if it's positive in this
case, you would have this

92
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,290
counterclockwise direction of
rotation of the spiral.

93
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,800
So now we can move
on and do the

94
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,550
following cases a bit faster.

95
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,840
So the second case, we are in
the case where we now have two

96
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,420
repeated eigenvalues.

97
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,980
Both of them are negative.

98
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,900
So we can have either
a complete case.

99
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,330
If we had a matrix that was
diagonal, we would have

100
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,680
basically a star.

101
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,790
But that's not the case,
because if we pick, for

102
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,640
example, the value c equals
to 1 that puts us on the

103
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,710
parabola, we can see that the
matrix Ac is not diagonal.

104
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,600
So we are in a defective case.

105
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,390
The defective case, if you
compute the eigenvalues in

106
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,640
eigenvector would give
you something

107
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,450
that looks like that.

108
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,760
The first rate of the
eigenvector corresponding to

109
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,400
your eigenvalues would be in
the direction of 1, 0.

110
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,450
We have negative eigenvalues,
so it's going to 0.

111
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,520
And basically, to determine the
direction, you have to see

112
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,460
that we are also following a
transition here on the trace

113
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,710
determined diagram.

114
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,490
And so basically, we will
have a spiral that

115
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,130
would look like this.

116
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,780

117
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,800
What am I doing?

118
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,050
Am I doing the same thing?

119
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:43,990

120
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,380
And it would basically rotate,
as you can see here, in the

121
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:57,750
same direction as the case
that we had just before.

122
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,470
Because we basically have the
transition of the structure of

123
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,320
the critical point.

124
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,510
And the arrows are pointing
toward the critical point

125
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,165
again because our two
eigenvalues are basically here

126
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:12,070
at negative, which is
just a repeated

127
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,270
eigenvalue that is negative.

128
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,410
So now we can move on to a third
case where here we move

129
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,700
into the wedge area where we
have the two eigenvalues now

130
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,370
being real, and both of
them are negative.

131
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:34,260
So for example, we would have
two eigenvalues that would

132
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,660
give us two eigenvectors that
are basically, they're rays.

133
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,940
The direction of the
trajectories on these two rays

134
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,640
would be toward the critical
point, because we have, again,

135
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,740
negative eigenvalues.

136
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,190
And the trajectories then would
be following the lambda.

137
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:57,530
So if I, for example, pick
lambda 1 less than lambda 2,

138
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,385
then I would have something
like this going to 0.

139
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:04,960

140
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,940
And we would have this
trajectory corresponding to

141
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,130
the eigenvalue that
is closer to 0.

142
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,940

143
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,940
And again, the arrows would
be going toward

144
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,340
this critical point.

145
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,670
So we can now move on.

146
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:25,750
And if we keep increasing c, we
reach now the point 4 where

147
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,360
we are in the special case,
again, a boundary case where

148
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,910
the determinant is 0.

149
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,120
But the trace is non-zero.

150
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,630
If the determinant is 0, which
is the product of the two

151
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,809
eigenvalues, it means that we
have one eigenvalue that is

152
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:42,299
equal to 0 and another
eigenvalue that is actually,

153
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,920
in this case, minus 2,
so just negative.

154
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,400
So what happens here?

155
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,870
What happens is that we have
now the eigenvector that

156
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,360
corresponds to the eigenvalue
equals to 0 is basically just

157
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,940
defining a whole line
of critical points.

158
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,880
So all the points on this line
that would correspond, so for

159
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,530
example, to lambda 0 are
all critical points.

160
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,830
So we don't need to actually
draw arrows here.

161
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,700
All the points would
be critical points.

162
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,350
And another direction or ray
would be determined by the

163
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,090
second eigenvalue
value, lambda 2.

164
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,950
And we would have, for example,

165
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,920
directions in this way.

166
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,710
It would correspond to
the direction of V2.

167
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,670
So all these would be
parallel to V2.

168
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:30,680
And we would have the
trajectories going toward all

169
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,290
the critical points
on this line.

170
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,480
So in this case, we're in a case
where we actually don't

171
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,310
have one localized critical
point like in the previous

172
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,260
case that we saw.

173
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,980
We've actually have a whole
line of critical points.

174
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,180
So let's move one
more point down.

175
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,530
So here, another value of c, we
now are in the lower part

176
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:53,450
of the diagram where we now have
two eigenvalues that are

177
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,510
again real.

178
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,730
But now, the determinant
is negative.

179
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,250
Determinant is the product
of the two.

180
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,620
So basically we know that one is
positive and the other one

181
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,060
is negative.

182
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:12,070
So for example here, we would
have one positive, the

183
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,990
negative eigenvalue value.

184
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:27,800

185
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,620
So we would have the positive
eigenvalue and the negative

186
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,650
eigenvalue here.

187
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,280
So here, again, we're just
moving in the structure of the

188
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,520
critical point.

189
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,080
So we should have a smooth
transition between the

190
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,160
diagrams going 1 to 5.

191
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,120
And so here, what we see is that
we actually have the ray

192
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,340
that is basically the stable
space here that would give us

193
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,490
the trajectories going to 0.

194
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,780
But it's the only region where
we have stability.

195
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:05,400
And all the trajectories will
just then be tangent in minus

196
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,220
infinity to the rate V1
corresponding to the negative

197
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,020
eigenvalue and going towards the
direction of the ray with

198
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,451
a positive eigenvalue
at plus infinity.

199
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:24,190
So we would have something
like that, that would

200
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,440
correspond to a saddle.

201
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,320

202
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,570
This would be a palm.

203
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,950

204
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:39,160
This is basically a sink or
basically a stable node.

205
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,900
This would be defective
stable node.

206
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,920
And here, we just have a
asymptotically stable spiral.

207
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,950
So basically here what you could
see is by just changing

208
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,950
the value of the constant c had
moved the structure of the

209
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,360
critical point of the system
from the phase

210
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,760
diagrams one to five.

211
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,080
And the transitions can be seen
to be smooth if you had a

212
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,410
continuum of values for c.

213
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,660
So that ends this recitation.

214
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,567
