LYDIA BOUROUIBA: Welcome to this
presentation on the trace

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,290
determinant diagram.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,930
So here, you're asked to label
the regions and lines of the

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,820
trace determinant diagram for a
2 x 2 general system, return

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,150
the form x prime equals Ax, and
to indicate the stability

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,000
on your diagram.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,290
So here, as a reminder, this
system is simply a system of

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,640
two differential equations in
vector form the derivative xy

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,190
equals abcd, a 2 x 2 matrix,
multiplying the vector xy.

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:42,090
Or in another form, it would be
x-dot equals f of xy, and

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,615
y-dot equals j of xy, where the
T wouldn't appear in f and

13
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:49,050
j here, functions, which means
that the system would be

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,140
autonomous, and we're dealing
with linear systems.

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,950
So why don't you pause
the video.

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,440
Take a few minutes remind
yourself what the trace

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,010
determinant diagram is and
how to label it, and

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,260
I'll be right back.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:10,830

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,620
Welcome back.

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,150
So let's remind ourselves where
this trace determinant

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,590
diagram comes from.

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,920
So initially, what we saw
before was to solve this

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,370
system, we need to find the
eigenvalues of the matrix A.

25
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:32,090
The eigenvalues are solutions of
this equation, which can be

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,310
written in the form lambda
square minus trace of lambda

27
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,150
plus determinant of
a equals to 0.

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,140
Let's call this D, and this T.
And the trace of A is just the

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,620
sum of the diagonals of the
matrix, and the determinant is

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,680
just, in this case for
a 2 x 2, ad minus cb.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,350
So the solutions for--

32
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,638
I'm going to call them
plus and minus--

33
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:06,390

34
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:13,030
for this second order polynomial
will simply be T

35
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,490
plus or minus the root of the
determinant of second order

36
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:24,930
polynomial, which is
T square minus 4D.

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,640
So the sign of T square minus
4D is going to determine

38
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,190
whether we are dealing with real
eigenvalues or complex

39
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,780
eigenvalues, or simply repeated
eigenvalues if we

40
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,905
have this determinant under
the root being equal to 0.

41
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:42,600

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:50,530
So just as a reminder here, if
we have T square over 4 equals

43
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,830
to D, we are in the case, well,
this is equal to 0.

44
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,760
Lambda plus or minus are the
same, and they're just equal

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,470
to the trace over 2.

46
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,920
So the sign of the trace is
going to determine whether we

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,780
have two repeated negative
eigenvalues or two repeated

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,790
positive eigenvalues.

49
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,690
Now, if we have the determinant
of the matrix A is

50
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,750
larger than T square over 4,
then we are above the curve

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,985
determined by this equation,
which is a parabola, which

52
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:24,690
I'll draw in a minute.

53
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,170
And in this case, we have the
number under the root being

54
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,560
negative, so we're dealing
with complex eigenvalues.

55
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,160
And basically, they're
just complex

56
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,210
conjugate of each other.

57
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,000
And you can notice here that
the trace would be also the

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,540
sum of the two eigenvalues, and
basically we would just

59
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,700
have 2 times the real part of
both lambda plus or minus,

60
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,676
just as a note.

61
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:58,360
And in the third case, where we
have that the determinant

62
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,580
is below T square over 4, we're
in the case where this

63
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,070
number under the root is
positive, so we're dealing

64
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,010
with two real eigenvalues.

65
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,590
So here, I should mention
this is real.

66
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,070
Lambda plus, lambda
minus real.

67
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,940
And we can have multiple
cases.

68
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,600
We can have lambda
plus larger than

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,185
lambda minus, both positive.

70
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:26,790
We can have lambda
plus, less than

71
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,590
lambda minus, both negative.

72
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,080
Or we can have lambda
plus positive and

73
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,085
lambda minus negative.

74
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:38,120
And each case will give
us a different

75
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,660
behavior of the system.

76
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,200
So let's first summarize this in
this following determinant

77
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,074
trace diagram, and then we'll
start labeling this diagram.

78
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:51,030

79
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,506
I should probably keep a
little more space here.

80
00:04:55,506 --> 00:05:02,080

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,740
So this is basically D equal T
square over 4 in our trace

82
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,940
determinant diagram.

83
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:20,970
I'm going to also erase this
part and just keep it in dots.

84
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,630
So in the first case that we
looked at, we are in the case

85
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,420
where we are right
on this parabola.

86
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,160
So that's the case where
we have lambda plus

87
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,870
equal lambda minus.

88
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,400
And you can see that if the
trace is positive, so if we

89
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,575
are on the right hand side of
the diagram, that we're going

90
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:40,930
to have two positive eigenvalues
that are both

91
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,120
real, and they are repeated.

92
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,920
So we can have multiple cases.

93
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,700
We can have the case where we
have a defective matrix, where

94
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,880
basically here we only have
one eigenvector associated

95
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,610
with this repeated eigenvalue.

96
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,700
And we have a defective case
where we need to come up with

97
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,370
a second eigenvector using the

98
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,600
generalized eigenvector formula.

99
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,882
And I'm not going to write this
here, but I'm going to

100
00:06:03,882 --> 00:06:06,140
just to do the diagram.

101
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:13,150
So for example, we would have
one direction, V1, where we

102
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,960
would have in this case lambda
1 and lambda minus positive.

103
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,990
So in the phase base, in yx, the
little diagram would show

104
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,340
us that the solution are
escaping from the critical

105
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,100
point, the equilibrium point.

106
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,240
And the second solution that
we build would have a

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,080
dependence in TV1, plus the
second eigenvector V2 also

108
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,420
directed by the positive
eigenvalue.

109
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,130
And so, we would have a
solution, for example, that

110
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:48,790
would look like this, with the
solution escaping from the

111
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,170
critical point because, again,
we are in the case where the

112
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,310
two eigenvalues are positive.

113
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,940
And so here, we could have it
in this form, or we can also

114
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,780
have the diagram in the
other direction.

115
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,906
And I'll to it in the other
direction on the other wing of

116
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:04,720
the diagram.

117
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,970
So this is the defective case.

118
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,684

119
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:13,330
Defective node.

120
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,220
The other possibility that we
could have on this parabola--

121
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,690
and I'm going to just
to it here--

122
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,010
will be the case where we
actually have all the

123
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,070
direction could be eigenvectors
associated with

124
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,850
this eigenvalue.

125
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,840
And this would be, for example,

126
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,410
for a diagonal matrix.

127
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:37,320
In which case, all the
directions would be escaping--

128
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,400
all the trajectories
would be escaping--

129
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,880
from the critical point.

130
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,190
And this would be a star.

131
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,660
Obviously here, we are in the
unstable case for the

132
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,200
defective node, and we are also
in the unstable case for

133
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,800
the star, because all the
solutions are escaping and

134
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,920
basically going away.

135
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,940
So if I start at the equilibrium
and I perturb it a

136
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,240
little bit, the solutions would
want to escape from that

137
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,980
equilibrium point.

138
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,040
On the other side here, it
would be exactly the same

139
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,140
structure, except that I would
have stability because the

140
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,150
trace is negative.

141
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:25,390
So I would have asymptotically
stable star.

142
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,460
Why asymptotically?

143
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,100
Because basically, it's when
T goes to infinity that the

144
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,580
trajectories reach the
critical point.

145
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,240
And this is again in the
phase base yx diagram.

146
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,190
For the defective node, we
would have this time, for

147
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,850
example, direction V1 attracting
the solutions,

148
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,980
there ray V1.

149
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,910
And the new trajectory that we
will be constructing based on

150
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,050
V1 again would be DV1 plus V2
generalized eigenvector.

151
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,970
Both of them would give us
solutions that converge toward

152
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,290
the equilibrium,
because the two

153
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,600
eigenvalues here are negative.

154
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:15,090
And so, we have that for large
time, minus infinity follows

155
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,750
V1, for plus infinity it's going
toward the equilibrium

156
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,860
points also follows V1.

157
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:26,870
So the solutions would have to
look like this, for example.

158
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:35,530
And this would be asymptotically
stable

159
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,950
defective node.

160
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,380
OK.

161
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,020
So we're done with the points
on the parabola.

162
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,350
So now let's look at the other
points, and I'll go maybe a

163
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,890
bit less in the details.

164
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:54,640
So for the case where we have
the determinant larger then T

165
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,040
square over 4, so we are just
above this parabola now, we

166
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,420
have the case where we have
two complex eigenvalues.

167
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,370
They are two complex
conjugates.

168
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,130
So let's assume that we can just
expand our solution and

169
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,190
write it in terms of the
exponential, in terms of the

170
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,570
real part of the eigenvalue.

171
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,020
So it would be determined,
again, the trace will give us

172
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,530
the sign of the real part of the
eigenvalue, multiplying a

173
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,520
cosine and a sine.

174
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,600
So we have something that is
rotating in phase base,

175
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,080
because we have basically
the periodicity.

176
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,900
But the distance to the critical
point is changing,

177
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,800
and it's either growing, if we
have a positive real part for

178
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,110
our eigenvalues, so if
we are on this side.

179
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,620
Or decaying if we are on the
left side of the diagram.

180
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,010
So that gives us typically
spirals.

181
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:53,870
So for example, that would be
a spiral, going toward 0,

182
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,160
toward the equilibrium
point in phase base.

183
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,010
And here, we would be in the
case where we have instability

184
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,500
due to the fact that the real
part of the eigenvalue

185
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,590
determining stability
is positive.

186
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,000
And so the solution of the
trajectories escape from the

187
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,450
critical point.

188
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,732
And similarly here, we could
have the same structure, but

189
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:20,250
I'm just going to draw it
in another direction.

190
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,920
Where here, we would
have stability.

191
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,430
Oops.

192
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,220
They should not cross.

193
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,816
This is not the right
way to draw this.

194
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:31,630

195
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,400
And it would be going toward
the critical point.

196
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,110
So here, just a quick note.

197
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,480
You can have this trajectory
being drawn this way.

198
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,665
So here, we have basically
a clockwise motion.

199
00:11:42,665 --> 00:11:45,540
But we could also have it be
drawn in the other way for

200
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,270
both cases, giving us
another direction of

201
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,610
rotation in phase base.

202
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,750
And the direction that you
choose will be determined by

203
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,150
the lowest left entry of your
matrix A, and I will just

204
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,350
explain quickly how
we do that.

205
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:02,590
OK.

206
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,470
So we have basically here in
stable spiral mode, and here

207
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:16,270
it's again asymptotically
stable a spiral.

208
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,620
So what happens now if
we are in this case.

209
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,060
We're still above the parabola,
so we have still

210
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,410
complex eigenvalues.

211
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,530
However, we have now the fact
that the trace is equal to 0,

212
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,600
which means that the
eigenvalues don't

213
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,760
have any real part.

214
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,450
So basically, we have
pure oscillation.

215
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,890
And in the phase base, that
corresponds to closed

216
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,390
trajectories that
could be circles

217
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,100
or ellipses, basically.

218
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,660
And so for example, we would
have something in this form

219
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,995
that would be called
the center.

220
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:54,180

221
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,050
And here again, you can have
either counterclockwise or a

222
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,420
clockwise rotation in phase base
depending on the signs of

223
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,740
the entries of your matrix.

224
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,260
So one thing I want to note is
that here, the stability for

225
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,020
the center we say that it's
simply stable, and not

226
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,180
asymptotically stable, because
the solution never actually

227
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,210
reaches the critical point, but
stays in the region around

228
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,800
the critical point.

229
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,440
So we're left with a few other
cases that are now all below

230
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,490
the parabola.

231
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,990
And for that, we just have
real eigenvalues.

232
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,670
So let's look at the case where
the eigenvalues have two

233
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,500
different signs.

234
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,300
So for that, we have
to have the

235
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,430
determinant being negative.

236
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,620
So this whole lower part of
the diagram, because the

237
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,685
determinant is the product
of the two eigenvalues.

238
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:51,080
So if they have different signs,
we're in this region.

239
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,840
So in this case, we could
have, for example, one

240
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:04,420
eigenvalue with associated
eigenvector V1 being negative.

241
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,060
So the trajectories along this
ray would be going toward

242
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,310
equilibrium point.

243
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,800

244
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,915
And then the other eigenvalue
will be positive.

245
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:22,550
So for example, lambda 2 here
would correspond to this other

246
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,340
eigenvector V2.

247
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,780
And so here, we would have
solutions that would be close

248
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,630
to V1 when we're coming, for
example, from minus infinity

249
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,080
approaching the critical
point.

250
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,010
And then going back, approaching
V2 when we go at T

251
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,350
plus infinity, for example.

252
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,350
And so it gives us
pseudo-hyperbola form

253
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,850
here, of this form.

254
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,770

255
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,790
And this is said to be unstable,
because all those

256
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,740
solutions do not go to
the critical point.

257
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,400
But we have some stable
manifolds.

258
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,980
For example, the V1.

259
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,180
If we start on this ray, we
would be going toward the

260
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,840
critical point.

261
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,515
And if we start at the critical
point itself, it

262
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:07,710
would stay at the
critical point.

263
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,150
But it is unstable.

264
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,610
So now what happened
in these two

265
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,530
different regions to finish.

266
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,210
In these two different
regions--

267
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,230
and I'm going to have a little
bit more space here--

268
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,230
AUDIENCE: It's called
a saddle.

269
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,120
LYDIA BOUROUIBA: Oh, yeah.

270
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,750
Thank you.

271
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,380
And this would be a saddle,
and it's just

272
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,630
because of the shape.

273
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,350

274
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,820
I'm going to just add a little
bit of space here, so that we

275
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,750
can complete the diagram.

276
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,820
I'll be basically looking at the
regions here in the wedge,

277
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,790
where we are below
the parabola.

278
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,800
And I'm looking for
another color.

279
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,210
Maybe I'll just use white.

280
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:51,360
Now we are in the case where we
would have two eigenvalues.

281
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,480
Both real, so no oscillation.

282
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,800
But let's say both positive,
because we're basically on the

283
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,370
region where the trace
is positive.

284
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,810
Let's say that we have
one ray, V1.

285
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,250
One ray, V2.

286
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,100
The trajectories are going away
from the critical point,

287
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,840
because the two eigenvalues
are positive.

288
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,210
And now, what do the
other trajectories

289
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,560
do, where they follow--

290
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,110
so for example, they would
be following V2.

291
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,220
And I'm going to explain how.

292
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,260
So here, we're in the case
where obviously we're

293
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,830
unstable, because again, the
solution, the trajectories are

294
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,530
going away from the
critical point.

295
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,260
And here, how do you pick which
ray do you follow when

296
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,970
you get closer to the
critical point?

297
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,250
Where in this case, we would
be in a situation where we

298
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:49,720
have lambda 2 smaller than
lambda 1, larger than 0.

299
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,470
So basically, the lambda 2 that
is the closer to 0-- and

300
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,300
that's also the case for the
positive and the negative

301
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,330
eigenvalues--

302
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,470
is the one that determines the
solution closer to the

303
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,390
critical point.

304
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:06,619
And the larger in absolute
eigenvalue and its ray then

305
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,869
determines the behavior--

306
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:11,980

307
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,339
Oh, sorry.

308
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,109
There's a mistake here.

309
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,530
It should be lambda 1.

310
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,540

311
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,720
I said it, but I think
I wrote it reversely.

312
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,530
Yeah The eigenvalue closer to
0 is the one that determines

313
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,329
the behavior at 0.

314
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,829
So here, when we're going
to infinity, the larger

315
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,990
eigenvalue lambda 2 will
determine the behavior, and

316
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,530
the trajectories will become
more and more parallel to V2.

317
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,520
So what happens on this side
would be exactly the same

318
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,146
diagram, and I'm just going
to do it with the same--

319
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:45,560
let's say, V2 here.

320
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:55,400
Except that we would have our
trajectories going toward the

321
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,650
critical point.

322
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,980

323
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,830
And the trajectory here again
would be closer to V1, which

324
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,550
means that we would have a case
where we have lambda 1

325
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,600
less than 0 and larger
than lambda 2.

326
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,920
So that finishes roughly
the diagram.

327
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,530
I didn't detail a few
borderline regions.

328
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,360
For example, the region where
the determinant equals to 0.

329
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,740
And we will discuss that
in another recitation.

330
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,420
And the case also at which the
determinant and the trace are

331
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,130
equal to 0.

332
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,140
So we'll detail that also.

333
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,890
But try to think about it
to complete the diagram.

334
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,850
So the key points here were
to remember what is the

335
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:44,730
determinant trace diagram, how
to basically deduce the nature

336
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,710
of the eigenvalues based
on T and D, their sign.

337
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,620
And where to place the different
structures on this

338
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,540
determinant trace diagram.

339
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,790
And that ends this recitation.

340
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,820
