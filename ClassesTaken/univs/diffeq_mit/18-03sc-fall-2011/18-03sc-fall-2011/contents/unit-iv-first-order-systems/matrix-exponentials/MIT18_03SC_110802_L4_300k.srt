00:00:05,247 --> 00:00:08,130
PROFESSOR: Welcome to this
recitation on matrix

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,390
exponential.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,520
So here, we're given matrix
A with entries 6, 5, 1, 2.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,290
And we're asked to compute
the matrix exponential,

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,530
exponential At, and to use it
to solve the initial value

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,350
problem u prime of t equals
Aut, where here, u are

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,120
basically vectors with initial
condition, u of 0 equals 4, 1.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,050
So why don't you pause
the video,

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,049
work through the problem?

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,299
And I'll be right back.

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:44,030

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,930
Welcome back.

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,490
So first, to go ahead and
compute the matrix

15
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,420
exponential, we need to identify
the eigenvalues of

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,990
matrix A and its eigenvectors.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,860
So this is a matrix--

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,872
I'll just rewrite here--

19
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:04,720
that we saw before.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:14,020
And its eigenvalues are again,
solution of 6 minus lambda 5,

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:22,380
1, 2 minus lambda equals to 0,
which gives us 6, 2 minus

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:31,570
lambda minus 5 equals to 0
lambda squared minus 8 lambda.

23
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,610
And we have a 12 minus 5.

24
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,410
So you can verify that the
eigenvalues would be 1 and 7.

25
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:49,980

26
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,980
Lambda 1 equals to 1.

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,530
And lambda 2 equals to 7.

28
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,260
So now, we need to seek the
eigenvectors associated to

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,680
each one of the eigenvalues.

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,540
So the idea here is to basically
move toward a

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,480
diagonalization of the matrix
A. So let's seek the

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,100
eigenvectors.

33
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,760
And here, I'm just going to give
them to you, and you can

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,130
verify the calculation.

35
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,090
And this calculation was
performed in a previous

36
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,200
recitation.

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,900
So the eigenvectors, V1
associated to the eigenvalue

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,650
lambda 1 was, for example,
1 minus 1.

39
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:39,550
And the other one that we found,
again, this is one form

40
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:47,200
of the eigenvector,
was 5 and 1.

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,912

42
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:53,660
So these are from the notes
of a previous recitation.

43
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,930
So you can verify that these
are the two eigenvectors.

44
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:03,720
And from this point, then we can
rewrite this solution, if

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,780
you recall.

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,440
I'm just going to go through
the steps toward getting to

47
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,660
the definition of the
exponential matrix.

48
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,830
So here, if we didn't know
anything about the exponential

49
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,940
matrix, we would be able to
write the solution as C1

50
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:29,970
exponential t V1 plus C2
exponential 7t V2, which

51
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,840
basically gives us here, if I
write it in this form, for

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:45,160
example, an exponential t minus
exponential t and an

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,940
exponential 5t multiplied by the
entry of this vector, an

54
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:57,010
exponential 7t here multiplying
C1, C2.

55
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,900
So this is where the
idea of the matrix

56
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,340
exponential comes from.

57
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:10,690
We're basically introducing the
matrix phi of t for which

58
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,200
we can write u equals phi of
t multiplied by this C1, C2

59
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,579
general constant.

60
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:24,240
So phi of t would then be
equal to this matrix.

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,410
But what we want is to be able
to solve an initial value

62
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:39,270
problem for which e of A of
0 applied to our initial

63
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:46,260
conditions would give us back
our initial condition.

64
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,670
So we're seeking for a form for
this exponential matrix

65
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,260
that would allow
us to do this.

66
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,880
So the way that we define the
matrix exponential give us

67
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,500
exponential At.

68
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,660
Now, I'm going to the proof, but
we're just going to check

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,930
it together, multiplied
by phi of 0 minus 1.

70
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,030
So let's check that if we use
this form of the matrix

71
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,590
exponential, we would have e.

72
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,920

73
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:26,740
We will have that at
0 applied to u0.

74
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:37,210
We have phi 0, phi 0 minus
1 applied to u0.

75
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,140
This is a matrix with
its inverse, which

76
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,780
gives us the identity.

77
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,820
And so basically, this gives
us back u of zero.

78
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,170

79
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,260
I mean you don't need to do that
when you're asked to find

80
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,480
the matrix exponential.

81
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,780
But just to remember where it's
coming from, you write

82
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,900
down your system
in matrix form.

83
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,940
You identify the matrix
phi of t.

84
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,930
And then you recall why you want
the matrix exponential to

85
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,490
have this form, basically to be
able to solve initial value

86
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:14,620
problems for which the value u
of t is projected to u of 0

87
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,500
when we take t equals 0 for
the matrix exponential.

88
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,070
So now let's go back
to our problem.

89
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,020
So let's compute this
matrix exponential.

90
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,300
We have phi of t.

91
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,730
So now from this formula, we
know that we need phi of 0.

92
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:37,570
So that give us, basically,
exponential of 0, 5,

93
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:42,080
minus 1, and 1.

94
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,390
We need to find its inverse.

95
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:52,910
So recall that the inverse
of a two-by-two matrix is

96
00:06:52,910 --> 00:07:01,900
basically just the determinant,
minus B minus C

97
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,860
and reversing the diagonal
entries.

98
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,850
So we can just apply this to
get our phi of 0 minus 1.

99
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:16,260
So here, our determinant
is basically 1 plus 5,

100
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,800
which is 1 over 6.

101
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,620
And then the entries are simply
1, 1, minus 5, and 1.

102
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,480
So now, we're just left with
the multiplication of two

103
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,442
matrices to get our matrix
exponential.

104
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:42,500
So our matrix exponential would
give us this one sixth.

105
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,150
And we now have to multiply
the entries.

106
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,850
So I'm not going to rewrite
everything.

107
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,280
I'm just going to use
this space here.

108
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,860
So we have exponential t
multiplying 1 plus 5

109
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,110
exponential 7t.

110
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:04,280

111
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,520
Then, we have exponential t dot
minus 5 for this entry.

112
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,570

113
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:23,820
5 exponential t multiplying
our 7t.

114
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,980
Then for the second entry,
we basically have minus

115
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:41,710
exponential t1 exponential 7t1
minus exponential t minus 5

116
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,419
and exponential 7t1.

117
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:49,700

118
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,306
So we're done with the
matrix exponential.

119
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:56,790
So now we were asked to solve
for the initial value problem

120
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,570
with initial condition
4 and 1.

121
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,830
So how do we go about that?

122
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,960
Well, recall that I just
reminded you what did we want

123
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,650
to use this matrix
exponential for.

124
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,390
And what we wanted it for is
to be able to basically

125
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,030
project an initial condition
into a solution u of t, t

126
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,200
times later.

127
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,480
And we constructed this matrix
to be able to basically give

128
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,190
us this solution by just
multiplying the matrix by the

129
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,550
initial value vector.

130
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,450
So basically, to find the
solution of this initial value

131
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,110
problem, we simply need to
multiply this matrix by the

132
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,210
initial vector that
we were given.

133
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,830
And I'm just going to write it
here to not have to rewrite

134
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,340
everything.

135
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,090
And it was 4 and 1.

136
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,980
And this is u of 0.

137
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,150
So let me just do a dash here
just so that we can do the

138
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,840
computation.

139
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,415
And we would end up
with a solution--

140
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:57,770

141
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,510
I'm going to keep it in
matrix form for now.

142
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:07,750
So we end up with 4 exponential
t minus 5

143
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,500
exponential t, so minus
1 exponential t.

144
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,950
And we have a one sixth.

145
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:24,350
Here, 5 exponential 7t, so we
have 20, plus 5, so 25,

146
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,630
exponential 7t.

147
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,260

148
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,370
Then for the second entry of the
vector solution, we have

149
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:41,440
minus exponential here minus 4
that we add to a 5, and here,

150
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,540
a 7 multiplied by 4 that
we add to a 1.

151
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,310
So we have basically plus
5 exponential 7t.

152
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,380
And that basically gives
us one way of

153
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,370
writing this solution.

154
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:07,843
And we can split this down, if
we will, into two vectors,

155
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:15,940
plus t, minus 1, 1 exponential
7t, 25, 5.

156
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,610
And this form is as valid.

157
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,720
Yes, thank you.

158
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,060
So that ends the laborious
calculations.

159
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,700
But basically, the key point
here was just to remember

160
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,280
where is the matrix exponential
coming from,

161
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,270
basically, from the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors

162
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,120
of the original matrix present
in the system, and where is

163
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,230
the definition coming from, why
do we define it as phi of

164
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:49,590
t phi minus 1 of 0, and how
to use it then to give the

165
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,290
solution to an initial
value problem.

166
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,540
So that ends this recitation.

167
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,432
