1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,445

2
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:06,620
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,690
So in this session, we're going
to use the matrix method

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,330
to solve this linear system
of differential equations.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,130
These are x dot equals
6x plus 5y, and y dot

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,480
equals x plus 2y.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,470
So why don't you take a few
minutes to write down the

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,520
system in matrix form and
go through the matrix

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,380
method to solve it.

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,630
And I'll be right back.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:40,410

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,630
Welcome back.

13
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,870
So let's write down this
system in matrix form.

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,880
You would have a vector with
entries x and y prime equals a

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:01:02,750
matrix with entries 6, 5,
1, 2 multiplying the

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,390
column vector xy.

17
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,540
So now, we did big
part of the work.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,780
The matrix method tells us
that we need to find the

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,500
eigenvalues of this matrix
to be able to basically

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,780
diagonalize it and seek
eigenvectors so that then we

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,650
can just read off the solutions
and write the

22
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,130
solution of the system as a
linear combination of the

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,290
eigenvectors that we found.

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:33,480
So let's look for the
eigenvalues first.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,240
The eigenvalues would be
computed by seeking the

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:46,750
determinant of this matrix in
this form, 6 minus lambda, 5,

27
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,310
1, 2 minus lambda.

28
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,640
We're going to have an equation
on lambda, solve for

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,890
lambda, and the solutions
will be our eigenvalues.

30
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,080

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,500
So the determinant would be 6
minus lambda multiplying 2

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,700
minus lambda minus 5, 1
dot 5, equals to 0.

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,530
So here, the lambda that
lambda gives us

34
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,420
a lambda dot squared.

35
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,260
We have minus 6 lambda
minus 2 lambda, which

36
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,220
would be minus 8 lambda.

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,870
And then, we would have 2 dot 6,
which is 12, minus 5, which

38
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,010
gives us 7.

39
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,210
So quadratic equation in lambda,
and you can factorize

40
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,990
it and find the solutions, which
is lambda 1 equals to 1,

41
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,920
lambda 2 equals to 7.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,280
So we're done with
the first part.

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,640
These are our eigenvalues.

44
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,580
They're not repeated.

45
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,000
They're just completely
different and real valued.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,060
So now, we're going to look at
the eigenvectors associated to

47
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,310
each eigenvalue.

48
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:59,490

49
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,920
So first eigenvector would be
associated with lambda 1

50
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,170
equals to 1.

51
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,940

52
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,860
So we would be solving
this system.

53
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,580
We would be solving this
system with a new

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,570
matrix, 6 minus 1.

55
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,720
I'm going to spell out this
one so that 2 minus 1.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,190
So this is just our lambda,
multiplying an unknown vector

57
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:35,260
with components a1 and a2
equals to zero vector.

58
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,860
And basically here, the unknowns
are a1 and a2.

59
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:48,470
So this is simply 5, 5, 1, and
1, a1, a2 equals to 0, 0.

60
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,860
So as you saw before, here,
basically, we can read off the

61
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,760
equation as being 5a1 plus 5a2
equals to 0 and another one

62
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,080
which is a1 plus
a2 equals to 0.

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,430
They're the same equations.

64
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,030
So really, we just have a1
plus a2 equals to 0.

65
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:13,260
And so our vector V1 could be
picked to just have component

66
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,750
1, for example, a1
equals to 1.

67
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,899
And its second component
would just be minus 1.

68
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,320
That would be one
pick for our V1.

69
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,820
We could normalize this vector
if you wanted to.

70
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,940
I'm just going to keep
it like this for now.

71
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,680
So if we look now for the
second negative vector

72
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:38,530
corresponding to the second
eigenvalue of 7, I would be

73
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,990
looking for the components of
these vectors by doing a

74
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,330
similar solving for
the same thing.

75
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,410
And I'm going to spell it out
again so that you see where

76
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,795
the terms are coming from.

77
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:59,950
It's just 6 minus the value
of my lambda, 0, 0.

78
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,460
So here, we have 6 minus
7, which is 1, 5.

79
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,100
And then, we have 1 and 2 minus
7, which is minus 5.

80
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:16,040
So really, what do you have is
an equation minus 1 plus 5a2

81
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,290
in both cases.

82
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,870

83
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,380
So we can pick a value for
a1 or a2 and write

84
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,240
down a vector V2.

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,160
And for example, the form of
a1 equals to, let's pick a2

86
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,570
equals to 1.

87
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,630
And we would have a1 equals
to 5, for example.

88
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,440
Again, if you wanted an
orthonormal basis formed by

89
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,910
your V1, V2, you would just
normalize these two vectors.

90
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:54,380
So here, basically, we can then
rewrite the solution to

91
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:04,340
the original system as being
linear combinations of--

92
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,820
so I'm just going to write
it in vector form.

93
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,370
The first vector 1, I
keep it in V1, V2,

94
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,140
that way you see it.

95
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,910
And then, I'll go into
the component.

96
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,730

97
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:24,760
We'd have V1 exponential of the
value of lambda we found

98
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,210
that corresponds to V1.

99
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,220
So it would be 1 dot t.

100
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:36,230
And then, V2 exponential of
the lambda value that

101
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,480
corresponds to V2.

102
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,720

103
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,045
And then, basically, we
just have constants

104
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:45,030
of integration here.

105
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,320
And so the solution to this
problem would be linear

106
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,670
combination of the vectors by
the basis of our eigenvectors

107
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,950
and multiplied by the
exponentials assigned a value

108
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,330
of the eigenvalues that we found
when we looked for the

109
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,510
eigenvalues of the matrix
of the system.

110
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:06,280
So here, just know that like for
the 1D problem that we saw

111
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,970
before, we're building a
solution based on linear

112
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,940
combination of lucky guesses
that we used.

113
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,500
And in the one equation case, we
used a guess of e to lambda

114
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,880
dot t in 1D.

115
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,830
Here, in this case, we had a
guess of a vector in the form

116
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,300
of lambda dot t that we use.

117
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,220
And then, basically, we just
solved for the lambdas, and

118
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,130
solved for the V's,
and did a linear

119
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,000
combination of all the solutions.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,710
Like we did before in the 1D
case, we solved the lambda.

121
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,060
We had different values
of lambda.

122
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,770
We did a linear combinations
of the exponentials.

123
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,730
So that ends this problem.

124
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,790
And here, the key is just to
go through the method of

125
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,420
diagonalizing your matrix.

126
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,770
Basically, it's finding the
eigenvalues, and then

127
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,640
computing the eigenvectors
associated with that, and

128
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,940
writing your solutions in terms
of a linear combination

129
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,660
of the solution that you found.

130
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,127
