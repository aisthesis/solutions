00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,772

00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:08,150
PROFESSOR: Welcome to
this recitation.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,860
In this recitation, we're
going to look at linear

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,630
systems with complex roots.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,700
So the system we're examining
is the one giving us x dot

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,640
equals minus 3x minus 2, and
y dot equals 5x minus y.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,890
And you're asked to use
the matrix methods

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,570
to solve this system.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,110
So why don't you take
a pause here and try

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,460
to solve this problem?

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,710
And I'll be right back.

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:37,460

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,000
Welcome back.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,520
So the first step is to write
this system in matrix form.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,510

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:53,080
So we introduced a vector xy,
the matrix multiplying column

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,030
vector xy again.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,770
The coefficients are going
to be minus 3,

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,440
minus 2, 5, minus 1.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,959

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,680
So the first step in solving
this system is to find the

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:18,380
eigenvalues of the matrix A.

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,730
So the eigenvalues of matrix A
are basically the solutions to

24
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,470
this following determinant
equal to 0, minus 3 minus

25
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:33,150
lambda minus 2, 5, minus 1
minus lambda, determinant

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,280
equals to 0.

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,500
Here, the lambda are the
unknown eigenvalues.

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,350
And to get this determinant,
we're basically multiplying

29
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:48,360
these two terms, minus
minus 2 dot 5, which

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,180
gives us a plus sign.

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,340
So here, we're going to
have lambda squared.

32
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,450
3 lambda plus 1 lambda
gives us 4 lambda.

33
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:10,410
And 3 plus 10 gives us 13.

34
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,580
So this second order polynomial
in lambda will give

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,715
us the two eigenvalues
for this matrix.

36
00:02:18,715 --> 00:02:21,260
So let's examine the
discriminant.

37
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,690
So we have v squared
minus 4ab.

38
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,160
And this gives us minus 36.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,800
So the discriminant
is negative.

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,630
And that tells us that we are
going to have two complex

41
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,440
roots, which is the title
of the recitation.

42
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,640
And these two complex roots
are going to be complex

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,740
conjugate of each other.

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,300
So formula gives us plus or
minus i of 6 for the root of

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,480
the discriminant.

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,100
Here, we have minus 4 over 2.

47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,560
So the two roots are basically
minus 2 plus

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,110
or minus i3 or 3i.

49
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,920

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,610
So these are our two roots.

51
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,840
So now, let's focus on one
of the roots to get the

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,370
eigenvector associated
with the eigenvalue.

53
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,490

54
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,395
So let's focus on the positive
one, for example.

55
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:27,680

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,870
And we could do all the
following again--

57
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,760
AUDIENCE: Minus 2.

58
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,210
PROFESSOR: Minus 2.

59
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,110
Thank you.

60
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,260
We can do all the following
calculation that I'm going to

61
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,910
go do now for the complex
conjugate, and I will explain

62
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,550
at the end how that basically
not change the result.

63
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,190
So for this eigenvalue, we
need to compute now the

64
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,410
eigenvector.

65
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:54,220
So to do that, we basically have
to use minus 3 minus--

66
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,082
I'm just going to write the
system here, let you

67
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:58,332
see what I'm doing.

68
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:02,060

69
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:10,340
And we are solving
this system.

70
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,950
So where does this
system come from?

71
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,279
It comes from the fact that
we're looking for an

72
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:22,900
eigenvector, v plus, that is
defined as av plus equals

73
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,370
lambda plus v plus.

74
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,800
And you can then bring
everything on the left-hand

75
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,200
side, a minus lambda i
applied to v plus,

76
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,680
gives us the zero vector.

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,070
So that's what we have here.

78
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,280
The unknowns on a1, a2,
and we're going to try

79
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,310
to solve for this.

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,925
So if we plug in now for the
value of lambda plus that we

81
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:43,850
have, we have minus 3 plus 2,
which gives us minus 1.

82
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,640
And then, we have a minus
3i and minus 2.

83
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,760
And for the second line, second
entry of this matrix

84
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,530
you have 5 minus 1
minus minus 2.

85
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,600
So we have 2 minus
1, which is 1.

86
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,890
And then, we have minus 3i.

87
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,770

88
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,200
A1, a2 equals to 0, 0.

89
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,840
So here, you can check for
yourself that these two

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,930
equations given by the first
line and the second line are

91
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,360
actually the same.

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,690
And so basically, to get a1 and
a2, it is sufficient to

93
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,680
just solve, for example, the
first one, where here, I just

94
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,450
wrote minus 1 minus 3i
multiplied by a1.

95
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,080
Minus 2 a2 equals to 0.

96
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,110
And I just brought the
minus 2 on this side.

97
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,250
So here, you can see that if we
take a1 equals to 0 equals

98
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,030
to plus 2, which would be our
first entry, we can then

99
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,070
cancel out these two and
just have a2 equals to

100
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,860
minus 1 minus 3i.

101
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,890
So this would be one eigenvector
associated with

102
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,210
this eigenvalue.

103
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,850
We could have picked
other ones.

104
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,810
They're basically a parallel
to this one.

105
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,290

106
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,240
So now what?

107
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,100
So what we need to remember is
the meaning of all of this.

108
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,790
Seeking the eigenvalues and the
eigenvectors is basically

109
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:14,200
equivalent to seeking a solution
in the form lambda t

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,150
exponential lambda t with the
direction of the eigenvector

111
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,940
associated with this
eigenvalue.

112
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,260
So now that we actually have
this eigenvector and this

113
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,160
eigenvalue, we can write
down the solution.

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,030
And I'm just going to write the
solution in x, which has

115
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,870
entries basically x and y.

116
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,400
And one way of writing it would
be just to basically

117
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,870
first start by writing
what we have there.

118
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,940

119
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,520
I'm just going to
spell it out.

120
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:53,230
So we have this multiplied
by 2 minus 3i.

121
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,550
So what do we do with this?

122
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,520
Well, we remember our
earlier formula.

123
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,860
So this is exponential minus
2t plus exponential 3it.

124
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,100
So we can split the exponential
3it into a cosine

125
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,190
and a sine.

126
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,290
And this, we're going to also
be able to split it into the

127
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,220
complex part and
the real part.

128
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,170
And then, we're going to combine
the real part and the

129
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,220
complex part.

130
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,640
So let's do that.

131
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:23,250
Exponential minus 2t
multiplying, basically, cosine

132
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:35,440
3t plus i sine 3t for the entry
2 minus 1 minus 3i.

133
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,370
So we have an i here
and an i here.

134
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:47,490
So things can be combined
into a real part.

135
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,530
So in the first entry here,
what are we going to have?

136
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,730
We're going to have cos
3t multiplying 2.

137
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,980
That's going to be
in the real part.

138
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,400

139
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,770
And I'm going to keep
some space.

140
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:05,260

141
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,850
And another entry here at the
second entry of this vector is

142
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:16,410
going to give us cosine 3t
multiplied by minus 1.

143
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,850
Oops, here, it should be a 3t.

144
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,100
Sorry.

145
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,710

146
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,840
So minus cosine 3t.

147
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,420
Now, where are we going to have
another real part here?

148
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,110
It's going to come from
a multiplication of

149
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,580
i sine 3t by 3i.

150
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,620
So the two i's together
gives a minus 1.

151
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:44,030
And we end up with
a plus 3 sine 3t.

152
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,860
So we're done for
the real part.

153
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,410
Now let's focus on the
imaginary part.

154
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,060
What do we have?

155
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,540
We have an i sine 3t
multiplying a 2.

156
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:56,280

157
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,810
And we have a minus 3i here
multiplying cosine 3t.

158
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:09,120
So we want to have a minus 3
cosine 3t, and finally, this

159
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,020
minus 1 multiplying
this sine 3t.

160
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,200

161
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,320
So now, we did--

162
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

163
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,640
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.

164
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,730
Thank you.

165
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,470
2, from this operation.

166
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,880
So now, we did split our
solution into a real part and

167
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,930
an imaginary part.

168
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,520
So how can we write the general

169
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,400
solution of the system?

170
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,880
Well, we knew that for this
linear system of equations.

171
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,940
If we have a complex number
that is a solution to be a

172
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,700
linear equation, then its real
part and its imaginary part

173
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,180
are also two independent
solutions.

174
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,110
So we can write the general
solution of the system as a

175
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,860
linear combination of the real
part and the imaginary part.

176
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:05,845
And I can just label
this u1 of t and u2

177
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:09,320
of t here and vector.

178
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,520
And we can then write the
general solution terms of any

179
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,320
constant that would be
determined by the initial

180
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,120
condition if we had one.

181
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:28,110
Exponential minus 2t along u1
plus c2 exponential minus 2t

182
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:35,380
along vector u2, which are also
functions of t, just the

183
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,920
difference from what
we had before.

184
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,690
So here, basically we seek
for the eigenvalues

185
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,590
values of the matrix.

186
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,770
We looked for the eigenvector
associated with the complex

187
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,650
eigenvalue.

188
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,470
We were able to write
the full solution.

189
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,180
And then, because of the
linearity property, we were

190
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,440
able to just then extract
two linearly independent

191
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,490
solutions, the real part of the
solution we had and the

192
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,360
imaginary part of the
solution we had.

193
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,740
So what I mentioned earlier
was that we could do this

194
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,970
whole calculation for the other
eigenvalue with a minus.

195
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,800
If you try to do it and trickle
down your minus, you

196
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,450
would see that basically you
would just end up with minus

197
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,410
signs here for basically
in front of the sines.

198
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,620
And what you could do then is
just simply absorb that minus

199
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,310
sign for the general solution
in c1 and c2.

200
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,810
And basically, it gives you
exactly the same form for the

201
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,620
general solution.

202
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,380
So you don't need to redo
it for the second one.

203
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,090
You would still end up with only
two linearly independent

204
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,400
solutions, not four.

205
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,770
OK, so that ends this
recitation.

206
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,393
