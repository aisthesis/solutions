1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06

2
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
The last time I spent solving a
system of equations dealing with

3
00:00:04 --> 00:00:10
the chilling of this hardboiled
egg being put in an ice bath.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:15
We called T1 the temperature of
the yoke and T2 the temperature

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
of the white.
What I am going to do is

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
revisit that same system of
equations, but basically the

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
topic for today is to learn to
solve that system of equations

8
00:00:26 --> 00:00:32
by a completely different
method.

9
00:00:30 --> 00:00:36
It is the method that is
normally used in practice.

10
00:00:34 --> 00:00:40
Elimination is used mostly by
people who have forgotten how to

11
00:00:39 --> 00:00:45
do it any other way.
Now, in order to make it a

12
00:00:43 --> 00:00:49
little more general,
I am not going to use the

13
00:00:46 --> 00:00:52
dependent variables T1 and T2
because they suggest temperature

14
00:00:52 --> 00:00:58
a little too closely.
Let's change them to neutral

15
00:00:56 --> 00:01:02
variables.
I will use x equals T1,

16
00:01:00 --> 00:01:06
and for T2 I will just use
y.

17
00:01:02 --> 00:01:08
I am not going to re-derive
anything.

18
00:01:05 --> 00:01:11
I am not going to resolve
anything.

19
00:01:08 --> 00:01:14
I am not going to repeat
anything of what I did last

20
00:01:12 --> 00:01:18
time, except to write down to
remind you what the system was

21
00:01:17 --> 00:01:23
in terms of these variables,
the system we derived using the

22
00:01:21 --> 00:01:27
particular conductivity
constants, two and three,

23
00:01:25 --> 00:01:31
respectively.
The system was this one,

24
00:01:28 --> 00:01:34
minus 2x plus 2y.
And the y prime was 

25
00:01:34 --> 00:01:40
2x minus 5y.
And so we solved this by

26
00:01:38 --> 00:01:44
elimination.
We got a single second-order

27
00:01:42 --> 00:01:48
equation with constant
coefficients,

28
00:01:46 --> 00:01:52
which we solved in the usual
way.

29
00:01:49 --> 00:01:55
From that I derived what the x
was, from that we derived what

30
00:01:54 --> 00:02:00
the y was, and then I put them
all together.

31
00:02:00 --> 00:02:06
I will just remind you what the
final solution was when written

32
00:02:05 --> 00:02:11
out in terms of arbitrary
constants.

33
00:02:08 --> 00:02:14
It was c1 times e to the
negative t plus c2 e to the

34
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
negative 6t, 
and y was c1 over 2 e

35
00:02:18 --> 00:02:24
to the negative t minus 2c2 e to
the negative 6t.

36
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
That was the solution we got.

37
00:02:30 --> 00:02:36
And then I went on to put in
initial conditions,

38
00:02:33 --> 00:02:39
but we are not going to explore
that aspect of it today.

39
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
We will in a week or so.
This was the general solution

40
00:02:40 --> 00:02:46
because it had two arbitrary
constants in it.

41
00:02:44 --> 00:02:50

42
00:02:49 --> 00:02:55
What I want to do now is
revisit this and do it by a

43
00:02:54 --> 00:03:00
different method,
which makes heavy use of

44
00:02:58 --> 00:03:04
matrices.
That is a prerequisite for this

45
00:03:02 --> 00:03:08
course, so I am assuming that
you reviewed a little bit about

46
00:03:06 --> 00:03:12
matrices.
And it is in your book.

47
00:03:09 --> 00:03:15
Your book puts in a nice little
review section.

48
00:03:12 --> 00:03:18
Two-by-two and three-by-three
will be good enough for 18.03

49
00:03:17 --> 00:03:23
mostly because I don't want you
to calculate all night on bigger

50
00:03:21 --> 00:03:27
matrices, bigger systems.
So nothing serious,

51
00:03:25 --> 00:03:31
matrix multiplication,
solving systems of linear

52
00:03:28 --> 00:03:34
equations, end-by-end systems.
I will remind you at the

53
00:03:34 --> 00:03:40
appropriate places today of what
it is you need to remember.

54
00:03:39 --> 00:03:45
The very first thing we are
going to do is,

55
00:03:43 --> 00:03:49
let's see.
I haven't figured out the color

56
00:03:46 --> 00:03:52
coding for this lecture yet,
but let's make this system in

57
00:03:51 --> 00:03:57
green and the solution can be in
purple.

58
00:03:55 --> 00:04:01
Invisible purple,
but I have a lot of it.

59
00:04:00 --> 00:04:06

60
00:04:05 --> 00:04:11
Let's abbreviate,
first of all,

61
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
the system using matrices.
I am going to make a column

62
00:04:11 --> 00:04:17
vector out of (x,
y).

63
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
Then you differentiate a column
vector by differentiating each

64
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
component.
I can write the left-hand side

65
00:04:22 --> 00:04:28
of the system as (x,
y) prime.

66
00:04:24 --> 00:04:30
How about the right-hand side?

67
00:04:29 --> 00:04:35
Well, I say I can just write
the matrix of coefficients to

68
00:04:33 --> 00:04:39
negative 2, 2,
2, negative 5 times x,y.

69
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42

70
00:04:38 --> 00:04:44
And I say that this matrix
equation says exactly the same

71
00:04:42 --> 00:04:48
thing as that green equation
and, therefore,

72
00:04:45 --> 00:04:51
it is legitimate to put it up
in green, too.

73
00:04:50 --> 00:04:56

74
00:04:55 --> 00:05:01
The top here is x prime.
What is the top here?

75
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
After I multiply these two I
get a column vector.

76
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
And what is its top entry?
It is negative 2x plus 2y.

77
00:05:18 --> 00:05:24
There it is.

78
00:05:22 --> 00:05:28
And the bottom entry the same
way is 2x minus 5y,

79
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
just as it is down there.
Now, what I want to do is,

80
00:05:42 --> 00:05:48
well, maybe I should translate
the solution.

81
00:05:49 --> 00:05:55
What does the solution look
like?

82
00:05:58 --> 00:06:04
We got that,
too.

83
00:05:58 --> 00:06:04
How am I going to write this as
a matrix equation?

84
00:05:58 --> 00:06:04
Actually, if I told you to use
matrices, use vectors,

85
00:05:59 --> 00:06:05
the point at which you might be
most hesitant is this one right

86
00:05:59 --> 00:06:05
here, the very next step.
Because how you should write it

87
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
is extremely well-concealed in
this notation.

88
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
But the point is,
this is a column vector and I

89
00:06:01 --> 00:06:07
am adding together two column
vectors.

90
00:06:01 --> 00:06:07
And what is in each one of the
column vectors?

91
00:06:02 --> 00:06:08
Think of these two things as a
column vector.

92
00:06:05 --> 00:06:11
Pull out all the scalars from
them that you can.

93
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
Well, you see that c1 is a
common factor of both entries

94
00:06:14 --> 00:06:20
and so is e to the negative t,
that function.

95
00:06:18 --> 00:06:24
Now, if I pull both of those
out of the vector,

96
00:06:22 --> 00:06:28
what is left of the vector?
Well, you cannot even see it.

97
00:06:26 --> 00:06:32
What is left is a 1 up here and
a one-half there.

98
00:06:32 --> 00:06:38
So I am going to write that in
the following form.

99
00:06:35 --> 00:06:41
I will put out the c1,
it's the common factor in both,

100
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
and put that out front.
Then I will put in the guts of

101
00:06:42 --> 00:06:48
the vector, even though you
cannot see it,

102
00:06:44 --> 00:06:50
the column vector 1,
one-half.

103
00:06:46 --> 00:06:52
And then I will put the other

104
00:06:49 --> 00:06:55
scalar function in back.
The only reason for putting one

105
00:06:52 --> 00:06:58
of these in front and one in
back is visual so to make it

106
00:06:56 --> 00:07:02
easy to read.
There is no other reason.

107
00:07:00 --> 00:07:06
You could put the c1 here,
you could put it here,

108
00:07:03 --> 00:07:09
you could put the e negative t
in front if you want

109
00:07:07 --> 00:07:13
to, but people will fire you.
Don't do that.

110
00:07:10 --> 00:07:16
Write it the standard way
because that is the way that it

111
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
is easiest to read.
The constants out front,

112
00:07:16 --> 00:07:22
the functions behind,
and the column vector of

113
00:07:19 --> 00:07:25
numbers in the middle.
And so the other one will be

114
00:07:22 --> 00:07:28
written how?
Well, here, that one is a

115
00:07:25 --> 00:07:31
little more transparent.
c2, 1, 2 and the other thing is

116
00:07:30 --> 00:07:36
e to the negative 6t.

117
00:07:33 --> 00:07:39
There is our solution.
That is going to need a lot of

118
00:07:38 --> 00:07:44
purple, but I have it.

119
00:07:41 --> 00:07:47

120
00:07:47 --> 00:07:53
And now I want to talk about
how the new method of solving

121
00:07:50 --> 00:07:56
the equation.
It is based just on the same

122
00:07:52 --> 00:07:58
idea as the way we solve
second-order equations.

123
00:07:54 --> 00:08:00
Yes, question.

124
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02

125
00:08:04 --> 00:08:10
Oh, here.
Sorry.

126
00:08:04 --> 00:08:10
This should be negative two.
Thanks very much.

127
00:08:07 --> 00:08:13
What I am going to use is a
trial solution.

128
00:08:10 --> 00:08:16
Remember when we had a
second-order equation with

129
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
constant coefficients the very
first thing I did was I said we

130
00:08:17 --> 00:08:23
are going to try a solution of
the form e to the rt.

131
00:08:21 --> 00:08:27
Why that?
Well, because Oiler thought of

132
00:08:23 --> 00:08:29
it and it has been known for
or 300 years that that is the

133
00:08:27 --> 00:08:33
thing you should do.
Well, this has not been known

134
00:08:32 --> 00:08:38
nearly as long because matrices
were only invented around 

135
00:08:36 --> 00:08:42
or so, and people did not really
use them to solve systems of

136
00:08:41 --> 00:08:47
differential equations until the
middle of the last century,

137
00:08:45 --> 00:08:51
1950-1960.
If you look at books written in

138
00:08:48 --> 00:08:54
1950, they won't even talk about
systems of differential

139
00:08:53 --> 00:08:59
equations, or talk very little
anyway and they won't solve them

140
00:08:57 --> 00:09:03
using matrices.
This is only 50 years old.

141
00:09:02 --> 00:09:08
I mean, my God,
in mathematics that is very up

142
00:09:06 --> 00:09:12
to date, particularly elementary
mathematics.

143
00:09:09 --> 00:09:15
Anyway, the method of solving
is going to use as a trial

144
00:09:14 --> 00:09:20
solution.
Now, if you were left to your

145
00:09:18 --> 00:09:24
own devices you might say,
well, let's try x equals some

146
00:09:22 --> 00:09:28
constant times e to the lambda1
t and y

147
00:09:28 --> 00:09:34
equals some other constant times
e to the lambda2 t.

148
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
Now, if you try that,

149
00:09:37 --> 00:09:43
it is a sensible thing to try,
but it will turn out not to

150
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
work.
And that is the reason I have

151
00:09:45 --> 00:09:51
written out this particular
solution, so we can see what

152
00:09:49 --> 00:09:55
solutions look like.
The essential point is here is

153
00:09:53 --> 00:09:59
the basic solution I am trying
to find.

154
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
Here is another one.
Their form is a column vector

155
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
of constants.
But they both use the same

156
00:10:06 --> 00:10:12
exponential factor,
which is the point.

157
00:10:10 --> 00:10:16
In other words,
I should not use here,

158
00:10:14 --> 00:10:20
in my trial solution,
two different lambdas,

159
00:10:19 --> 00:10:25
I should use the same lambda.
And so the way to write the

160
00:10:26 --> 00:10:32
trial solution is (x,
y) equals two unknown numbers,

161
00:10:32 --> 00:10:38
that or that or whatever,
times e to a single unknown

162
00:10:38 --> 00:10:44
exponent factor.
Let's call it lambda t.

163
00:10:43 --> 00:10:49
It is called lambda.
It is called r.

164
00:10:46 --> 00:10:52
It is called m.
I have never seen it called

165
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
anything but one of those three
things.

166
00:10:52 --> 00:10:58
I am using lambda.
Your book uses lambda.

167
00:10:55 --> 00:11:01
It is a common choice.
Let's stick with it.

168
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
Now what is the next step?
Well, we plug into the system.

169
00:11:03 --> 00:11:09
Substitute into the system.
What are we going to get?

170
00:11:07 --> 00:11:13
Well, let's do it.
First of all,

171
00:11:09 --> 00:11:15
I have to differentiate.
The left-hand side asks me to

172
00:11:13 --> 00:11:19
differentiate this.
How do I differentiate this?

173
00:11:16 --> 00:11:22
Column vector times a function.
Well, the column vector acts as

174
00:11:20 --> 00:11:26
a constant.
And I differentiate that.

175
00:11:23 --> 00:11:29
That is lambda e to the lambda
t.

176
00:11:28 --> 00:11:34
So the (x, y) prime is (a1,
a2) times e to the lambda t

177
00:11:32 --> 00:11:38
times lambda.

178
00:11:35 --> 00:11:41
Now, it is ugly to put the

179
00:11:38 --> 00:11:44
lambda afterwards because it is
a number so you should put it in

180
00:11:42 --> 00:11:48
front, again,
to make things easier to read.

181
00:11:46 --> 00:11:52
But this lambda comes from
differentiating e to the lambda

182
00:11:50 --> 00:11:56
t and using the chain rule.

183
00:11:53 --> 00:11:59
This much is the left-hand
side.

184
00:11:56 --> 00:12:02
That is the derivative (x,
y) prime.

185
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
I differentiate the x and I
differentiated the y.

186
00:12:03 --> 00:12:09
How about the right-hand side.
Well, the right-hand side is

187
00:12:07 --> 00:12:13
negative 2, 2,
2, negative 5 times what?

188
00:12:09 --> 00:12:15
Well, times (x,

189
00:12:12 --> 00:12:18
y), which is (a1,
a2) e to the lambda t.

190
00:12:15 --> 00:12:21
Now, the same thing that

191
00:12:18 --> 00:12:24
happened a month or a month and
a half ago happens now.

192
00:12:22 --> 00:12:28
The whole point of making that
substitution is that the e to

193
00:12:26 --> 00:12:32
the lambda t,
the function part of it drops

194
00:12:30 --> 00:12:36
out completely.
And one is left with what?

195
00:12:35 --> 00:12:41
An algebraic equation to be
solved for lambda a1 and a2.

196
00:12:39 --> 00:12:45
In other words,
by means of that substitution,

197
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
and it basically uses the fact
that the coefficients are

198
00:12:48 --> 00:12:54
constant, what you have done is
reduced the problem of calculus,

199
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
of solving differential
equations, to solving algebraic

200
00:12:58 --> 00:13:04
equations.
In some sense that is the only

201
00:13:02 --> 00:13:08
method there is,
unless you do numerical stuff.

202
00:13:05 --> 00:13:11
You reduce the calculus to
algebra.

203
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
The Laplace transform is
exactly the same thing.

204
00:13:11 --> 00:13:17
All the work is algebra.
You turn the original

205
00:13:14 --> 00:13:20
differential equation into an
algebraic equation for Y of s,

206
00:13:19 --> 00:13:25
you solve it,
and then you use more algebra

207
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
to find out what the original
little y of t was.

208
00:13:27 --> 00:13:33
It is not different here.
So let's solve this system of

209
00:13:32 --> 00:13:38
equations.
Now, the whole problem with

210
00:13:34 --> 00:13:40
solving this system,
first of all,

211
00:13:37 --> 00:13:43
what is the system?
Let's write it out explicitly.

212
00:13:41 --> 00:13:47
Well, it is really two
equations, isn't it?

213
00:13:44 --> 00:13:50
The first one says lambda a1 is
equal to negative 2 a1 

214
00:13:49 --> 00:13:55
plus 2 a2.
That is the first one.

215
00:13:52 --> 00:13:58
The other one says lambda a2 is
equal to 2 a1 minus 5 a2.

216
00:13:56 --> 00:14:02

217
00:14:00 --> 00:14:06

218
00:14:06 --> 00:14:12
Now, purely,
if you want to classify that,

219
00:14:09 --> 00:14:15
that is two equations and three
variables, three unknowns.

220
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
The a1, a2, and lambda are all
unknown.

221
00:14:16 --> 00:14:22
And, unfortunately,
if you want to classify them

222
00:14:19 --> 00:14:25
correctly, they are nonlinear
equations because they are made

223
00:14:24 --> 00:14:30
nonlinear by the fact that you
have multiplied two of the

224
00:14:28 --> 00:14:34
variables.
Well, if you sit down and try

225
00:14:32 --> 00:14:38
to hack away at solving those
without a plan,

226
00:14:35 --> 00:14:41
you are not going to get
anywhere.

227
00:14:37 --> 00:14:43
It is going to be a mess.
Also, two equations and three

228
00:14:41 --> 00:14:47
unknowns is indeterminate.
You can solve three equations

229
00:14:46 --> 00:14:52
and three unknowns and get a
definite answer,

230
00:14:49 --> 00:14:55
but two equations and three
unknowns usually have an

231
00:14:53 --> 00:14:59
infinity of solutions.
Well, at this point it is the

232
00:14:56 --> 00:15:02
only idea that is required.
Well, this was a little idea,

233
00:15:02 --> 00:15:08
but I assume one would think of
that.

234
00:15:05 --> 00:15:11
And the idea that is required
here is, I think,

235
00:15:09 --> 00:15:15
not so unnatural,
it is not to view these a1,

236
00:15:13 --> 00:15:19
a2, and lambda as equal.
Not all variables are created

237
00:15:17 --> 00:15:23
equal.
Some are more equal than

238
00:15:20 --> 00:15:26
others.
a1 and a2 are definitely equal

239
00:15:23 --> 00:15:29
to each other,
and let's relegate lambda to

240
00:15:27 --> 00:15:33
the background.
In other words,

241
00:15:31 --> 00:15:37
I am going to think of lambda
as just a parameter.

242
00:15:34 --> 00:15:40
I am going to demote it from
the status of variable to

243
00:15:39 --> 00:15:45
parameter.
If I demoted it further it

244
00:15:41 --> 00:15:47
would just be an unknown
constant.

245
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
That is as bad as you can be.
I am going to focus my

246
00:15:48 --> 00:15:54
attention on the a1,
a2 and sort of view the lambda

247
00:15:52 --> 00:15:58
as a nuisance.
Now, as soon as I do that,

248
00:15:55 --> 00:16:01
I see that these equations are
linear if I just look at them as

249
00:15:59 --> 00:16:05
equations in a1 and a2.
And moreover,

250
00:16:04 --> 00:16:10
they are not just linear,
they are homogenous.

251
00:16:07 --> 00:16:13
Because if I think of lambda
just as a parameter,

252
00:16:11 --> 00:16:17
I should rewrite the equations
this way.

253
00:16:14 --> 00:16:20
I am going to subtract this and
move the left-hand side to the

254
00:16:19 --> 00:16:25
right side, and it is going to
look like (minus 2 minus lambda)

255
00:16:23 --> 00:16:29
times a1 plus 2 a2 is equal to
zero.

256
00:16:28 --> 00:16:34
And the same way for the other

257
00:16:32 --> 00:16:38
one.
It is going to be 2a1 plus,

258
00:16:35 --> 00:16:41
what is the coefficient,
(minus 5 minus lambda) a2

259
00:16:39 --> 00:16:45
equals zero.

260
00:16:43 --> 00:16:49
That is a pair of simultaneous
linear equations for determining

261
00:16:48 --> 00:16:54
a1 and a2, and the coefficients
involved are parameter lambda.

262
00:16:53 --> 00:16:59
Now, what is the point of doing
that?

263
00:16:58 --> 00:17:04
Well, now the point is whatever
you learned about linear

264
00:17:02 --> 00:17:08
equations, you should have
learned the most fundamental

265
00:17:06 --> 00:17:12
theorem of linear equations.
The main theorem is that you

266
00:17:10 --> 00:17:16
have a square system of
homogeneous equations,

267
00:17:13 --> 00:17:19
this is a two-by-two system so
it is square,

268
00:17:16 --> 00:17:22
it always has the trivial
solution, of course,

269
00:17:20 --> 00:17:26
a1, a2 equals zero.
Now, we don't want that trivial

270
00:17:24 --> 00:17:30
solution because if a1 and a2
are zero, then so are x and y

271
00:17:28 --> 00:17:34
zero.
Now that is a solution.

272
00:17:32 --> 00:17:38
Unfortunately,
it is of no interest.

273
00:17:35 --> 00:17:41
If the solution were x,
y zero, it corresponds to the

274
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
fact that this is an ice bath.
The yoke is at zero,

275
00:17:44 --> 00:17:50
the white is at zero and it
stays that way for all time

276
00:17:48 --> 00:17:54
until the ice melts.
So that is the solution we

277
00:17:52 --> 00:17:58
don't want.
We don't want the trivial

278
00:17:56 --> 00:18:02
solution.
Well, when does it have a

279
00:17:59 --> 00:18:05
nontrivial solution?
Nontrivial means non-zero,

280
00:18:03 --> 00:18:09
in other words.
If and only if this determinant

281
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
is zero.

282
00:18:10 --> 00:18:16

283
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
In other words,
by using that theorem on linear

284
00:18:22 --> 00:18:28
equations, what we find is there
is a condition that lambda must

285
00:18:28 --> 00:18:34
satisfy, an equation in lambda
in order that we would be able

286
00:18:33 --> 00:18:39
to find non-zero values for a1
and a2.

287
00:18:38 --> 00:18:44
Let's write it out.
I will recopy it over here.

288
00:18:41 --> 00:18:47
What was it?
Negative 2 minus lambda,

289
00:18:44 --> 00:18:50
two, here it was 2 and minus 5
minus lambda.

290
00:18:49 --> 00:18:55
All right.
You have to expand the

291
00:18:51 --> 00:18:57
determinant.
In other words,

292
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
we are trying to find out for
what values of lambda is this

293
00:18:58 --> 00:19:04
determinant zero.
Those will be the good values

294
00:19:03 --> 00:19:09
which lead to nontrivial
solutions for the a's.

295
00:19:06 --> 00:19:12
This is the equation lambda
plus 2.

296
00:19:09 --> 00:19:15
See, this is minus that and
minus that, the product of the

297
00:19:14 --> 00:19:20
two minus ones is plus one.
So it is lambda plus 2 times

298
00:19:18 --> 00:19:24
lambda plus 5,

299
00:19:21 --> 00:19:27
which is the product of the two
diagonal elements,

300
00:19:25 --> 00:19:31
minus the product of the two
anti-diagonal elements,

301
00:19:29 --> 00:19:35
which is 4, is equal to zero.
And if I write that out,

302
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
what is that,
that is the equation lambda

303
00:19:39 --> 00:19:45
squared plus 7 lambda,

304
00:19:43 --> 00:19:49
5 lambda plus 2 lambda,
and then the constant term is

305
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
10 minus 4 which is 6.
How many of you have long

306
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
enough memories,
two-day memories that you

307
00:19:56 --> 00:20:02
remember that equation?
When I did the method of

308
00:20:02 --> 00:20:08
elimination, it led to exactly
the same equation except it had

309
00:20:10 --> 00:20:16
r's in it instead of lambda.
And this equation,

310
00:20:15 --> 00:20:21
therefore, is given the same
name and another color.

311
00:20:21 --> 00:20:27
Let's make it salmon.

312
00:20:25 --> 00:20:31

313
00:20:30 --> 00:20:36
And it is called the
characteristic equation for this

314
00:20:34 --> 00:20:40
method.
All right.

315
00:20:36 --> 00:20:42
Now I am going to use now the
word from last time.

316
00:20:40 --> 00:20:46
You factor this.
From the factorization we get

317
00:20:44 --> 00:20:50
its root easily enough.
The roots are lambda equals

318
00:20:48 --> 00:20:54
negative 1 and
lambda equals negative 6

319
00:20:54 --> 00:21:00
by factoring the
equation.

320
00:20:57 --> 00:21:03
Now what I am supposed to do?
You have to keep the different

321
00:21:03 --> 00:21:09
parts of the method together.
Now I have found the only

322
00:21:08 --> 00:21:14
values of lambda for which I
will be able to find nonzero

323
00:21:12 --> 00:21:18
values for the a1 and a2.
For each of those values of

324
00:21:17 --> 00:21:23
lambda, I now have to find the
corresponding a1 and a2.

325
00:21:21 --> 00:21:27
Let's do them one at a time.
Let's take first lambda equals

326
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
negative one.
My problem is now to find a1

327
00:21:32 --> 00:21:38
and a2.
Where am I going to find them

328
00:21:35 --> 00:21:41
from?
Well, from that system of

329
00:21:38 --> 00:21:44
equations over there.
I will recopy it over here.

330
00:21:42 --> 00:21:48
What is the system?
The hardest part of this is

331
00:21:47 --> 00:21:53
dealing with multiple minus
signs, but you had experience

332
00:21:52 --> 00:21:58
with that in determinants so you
know all about that.

333
00:21:58 --> 00:22:04
In other words,
there is the system of

334
00:22:01 --> 00:22:07
equations over there.
Let's recopy them here.

335
00:22:06 --> 00:22:12
Minus 2, minus minus 1 makes
minus 1.

336
00:22:09 --> 00:22:15
What's the other coefficient?
It is just plain old 2.

337
00:22:15 --> 00:22:21
Good.
There is my first equation.

338
00:22:18 --> 00:22:24
And when I substitute lambda
equals negative one

339
00:22:24 --> 00:22:30
for the second equation,
what do you get?

340
00:22:30 --> 00:22:36
2 a1 plus negative 5 minus
negative 1 makes negative 4.

341
00:22:37 --> 00:22:43
There is my system that will
find me a1 and a2.

342
00:22:43 --> 00:22:49
What is the first thing you
notice about it?

343
00:22:48 --> 00:22:54
You immediately notice that
this system is fake because this

344
00:22:56 --> 00:23:02
second equation is twice the
first one.

345
00:23:03 --> 00:23:09
Something is wrong.
No, something is right.

346
00:23:06 --> 00:23:12
If that did not happen,
if the second equation were not

347
00:23:12 --> 00:23:18
a constant multiple of the first
one then the only solution of

348
00:23:17 --> 00:23:23
the system would be a1 equals
zero, a2 equals zero because the

349
00:23:23 --> 00:23:29
determinant of the coefficients
would not be zero.

350
00:23:29 --> 00:23:35
The whole function of this
exercise was to find the value

351
00:23:33 --> 00:23:39
of lambda, negative 1,
for which the system would be

352
00:23:37 --> 00:23:43
redundant and,
therefore, would have a

353
00:23:40 --> 00:23:46
nontrivial solution.
Do you get that?

354
00:23:43 --> 00:23:49
In other words,
calculate the system out,

355
00:23:47 --> 00:23:53
just as I have done here,
you have an automatic check on

356
00:23:51 --> 00:23:57
the method.
If one equation is not a

357
00:23:54 --> 00:24:00
constant multiple of the other
you made a mistake.

358
00:24:00 --> 00:24:06
You don't have the right value
of lambda or you substituted

359
00:24:05 --> 00:24:11
into the system wrong,
which is frankly a more common

360
00:24:10 --> 00:24:16
error.
Go back, recheck first the

361
00:24:13 --> 00:24:19
substitution,
and if convinced that is right

362
00:24:17 --> 00:24:23
then recheck where you got
lambda from.

363
00:24:20 --> 00:24:26
But here everything is going
fine so we can now find out what

364
00:24:26 --> 00:24:32
the value of a1 and a2 are.
You don't have to go through a

365
00:24:32 --> 00:24:38
big song and dance for this
since most of the time you will

366
00:24:36 --> 00:24:42
have two-by-two equations and
now and then three-by-three.

367
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
For two-by-two all you do is,
since we really have the same

368
00:24:44 --> 00:24:50
equation twice,
to get a solution I can assign

369
00:24:47 --> 00:24:53
one of the variables any value
and then simply solve for the

370
00:24:51 --> 00:24:57
other.
The natural thing to do is to

371
00:24:54 --> 00:25:00
make a2 equal one,
then I won't need fractions and

372
00:24:57 --> 00:25:03
then a1 will be a2.
So the solution is (2,

373
00:25:01 --> 00:25:07
1).
I am only trying to find one

374
00:25:04 --> 00:25:10
solution.
Any constant multiple of this

375
00:25:07 --> 00:25:13
would also be a solution,
as long as it wasn't zero,

376
00:25:12 --> 00:25:18
zero which is the trivial one.
And, therefore,

377
00:25:15 --> 00:25:21
this is a solution to this
system of algebraic equations.

378
00:25:20 --> 00:25:26
And the solution to the whole
system of differential equations

379
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
is, this is only the (a1,
a2) part.

380
00:25:30 --> 00:25:36
I have to add to it,
as a factor,

381
00:25:32 --> 00:25:38
lambda is negative,
therefore, e to the minus t.

382
00:25:36 --> 00:25:42
There is our purple thing.

383
00:25:40 --> 00:25:46

384
00:25:50 --> 00:25:56
See how I got it?
Starting with the trial

385
00:25:52 --> 00:25:58
solution, I first found out
through this procedure what the

386
00:25:57 --> 00:26:03
lambda's have to be.
Then I took the lambda and

387
00:26:00 --> 00:26:06
found what the corresponding a1
and a2 that went with it and

388
00:26:04 --> 00:26:10
then made up my solution out of
that.

389
00:26:06 --> 00:26:12
Now, quickly I will do the same
thing for lambda 

390
00:26:11 --> 00:26:17
equals negative 6.
Each one of these must be

391
00:26:13 --> 00:26:19
treated separately.
They are separate problems and

392
00:26:17 --> 00:26:23
you are looking for separate
solutions.

393
00:26:19 --> 00:26:25
Lambda equals negative 6.
What do I do?

394
00:26:22 --> 00:26:28
How do my equations look now?
Well, the first one is minus 2

395
00:26:25 --> 00:26:31
minus negative 6 makes plus 4.
It is 4a1 plus 2a2 equals zero.

396
00:26:32 --> 00:26:38
Then I hold my breath while I

397
00:26:37 --> 00:26:43
calculate the second one to see
if it comes out to be a constant

398
00:26:44 --> 00:26:50
multiple.
I get 2a1 plus negative 5 minus

399
00:26:49 --> 00:26:55
negative 6, which makes plus 1.
And, indeed,

400
00:26:54 --> 00:27:00
one is a constant multiple of
the other.

401
00:27:00 --> 00:27:06
I really only have on equation
there.

402
00:27:04 --> 00:27:10
I will just write down
immediately now what the

403
00:27:09 --> 00:27:15
solution is to the system.
Well, the (a1,

404
00:27:13 --> 00:27:19
a2) will be what?
Now, it is more natural to make

405
00:27:19 --> 00:27:25
a1 equal 1 and then solve to get
an integer for a2.

406
00:27:25 --> 00:27:31
If a1 is 1, then a2 is negative
2.

407
00:27:30 --> 00:27:36
And I should multiply that by e
to the negative 6t

408
00:27:34 --> 00:27:40
because negative 6 is the
corresponding value.

409
00:27:38 --> 00:27:44
There is my other one.
And now there is a

410
00:27:41 --> 00:27:47
superposition principle,
which if I get a chance will

411
00:27:44 --> 00:27:50
prove for you at the end of the
hour.

412
00:27:47 --> 00:27:53
If not, you will have to do it
yourself for homework.

413
00:27:51 --> 00:27:57
Since this is a linear system
of equations,

414
00:27:54 --> 00:28:00
once you have two separate
solutions, neither a constant

415
00:27:58 --> 00:28:04
multiple of the other,
you can multiply each one of

416
00:28:02 --> 00:28:08
these by a constant and it will
still be a solution.

417
00:28:08 --> 00:28:14
You can add them together and
that will still be a solution,

418
00:28:11 --> 00:28:17
and that gives the general
solution.

419
00:28:13 --> 00:28:19
The general solution is the sum
of these two,

420
00:28:16 --> 00:28:22
an arbitrary constant.
I am going to change the name

421
00:28:19 --> 00:28:25
since I don't want to confuse it
with the c1 I used before,

422
00:28:22 --> 00:28:28
times the first solution which
is (2, 1) e to the negative t

423
00:28:26 --> 00:28:32
plus c2, another arbitrary
constant, times 1 negative 2 e

424
00:28:29 --> 00:28:35
to the minus 6t.

425
00:28:32 --> 00:28:38
Now you notice that is exactly

426
00:28:37 --> 00:28:43
the same solution I got before.
The only difference is that I

427
00:28:43 --> 00:28:49
have renamed the arbitrary
constants.

428
00:28:47 --> 00:28:53
The relationship between them,
c1 over 2,

429
00:28:53 --> 00:28:59
I am now calling c1 tilda,
and c2 I am calling c2 tilda.

430
00:29:00 --> 00:29:06
If you have an arbitrary
constant, it doesn't matter

431
00:29:04 --> 00:29:10
whether you divide it by two.
It is still just an arbitrary a

432
00:29:09 --> 00:29:15
constant.
It covers all values,

433
00:29:12 --> 00:29:18
in other words.
Well, I think you will agree

434
00:29:16 --> 00:29:22
that is a different procedure,
yet it has only one

435
00:29:20 --> 00:29:26
coincidence.
It is like elimination goes

436
00:29:24 --> 00:29:30
this way and comes to the
answer.

437
00:29:28 --> 00:29:34
And this method goes a
completely different route and

438
00:29:31 --> 00:29:37
comes to the answer,
except it is not quite like

439
00:29:34 --> 00:29:40
that.
They walk like this and then

440
00:29:36 --> 00:29:42
they come within viewing
distance of each other to check

441
00:29:40 --> 00:29:46
that both are using the same
characteristic equation,

442
00:29:44 --> 00:29:50
and then they again go their
separate ways and end up with

443
00:29:48 --> 00:29:54
the same answer.

444
00:29:50 --> 00:29:56

445
00:29:58 --> 00:30:04
There is something special of
these values.

446
00:30:00 --> 00:30:06
You cannot get away from those
two values of lambda.

447
00:30:03 --> 00:30:09
Somehow they are really
intrinsically connected.

448
00:30:06 --> 00:30:12
Occurs the exponential
coefficient, and they are

449
00:30:09 --> 00:30:15
intrinsically connected with the
problem of the egg that we

450
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
started with.
Now what I would like to do is

451
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
very quickly sketch how this
method looks when I remove all

452
00:30:18 --> 00:30:24
the numbers from it.
In some sense,

453
00:30:20 --> 00:30:26
it becomes a little clearer
what is going on.

454
00:30:23 --> 00:30:29
And that will give me a chance
to introduce the terminology

455
00:30:26 --> 00:30:32
that you need when you talk
about it.

456
00:30:30 --> 00:30:36

457
00:30:55 --> 00:31:01
Well, you have notes.
Let me try to write it down in

458
00:31:03 --> 00:31:09
general.

459
00:31:05 --> 00:31:11

460
00:31:10 --> 00:31:16
I will first write it out
two-by-two.

461
00:31:13 --> 00:31:19
I am just going to sketch.
The system looks like (x,

462
00:31:18 --> 00:31:24
y) equals, I will still put it
up in colors.

463
00:31:23 --> 00:31:29

464
00:31:30 --> 00:31:36
Except now, instead of using
twos and fives,

465
00:31:33 --> 00:31:39
I will use (a,
b; c, d).

466
00:31:35 --> 00:31:41

467
00:31:40 --> 00:31:46
The trial solution will look
how?

468
00:31:44 --> 00:31:50
The trial is going to be (a1,
a2).

469
00:31:48 --> 00:31:54
That I don't have to change the
name of.

470
00:31:53 --> 00:31:59
I am going to substitute in,
and what the result of

471
00:31:59 --> 00:32:05
substitution is going to be
lambda (a1, a2).

472
00:32:06 --> 00:32:12
I am going to skip a step and
pretend that the e to the lambda

473
00:32:11 --> 00:32:17
t's have already
been canceled out.

474
00:32:16 --> 00:32:22
Is equal to (a,
b; c, d) times (a1,

475
00:32:19 --> 00:32:25
a2).
What does that correspond to?

476
00:32:22 --> 00:32:28
That corresponds to the system
as I wrote it here.

477
00:32:28 --> 00:32:34
And then we wrote it out in
terms of two equations.

478
00:32:31 --> 00:32:37
And what was the resulting
thing that we ended up with?

479
00:32:35 --> 00:32:41
Well, you write it out,
you move the lambda to the

480
00:32:38 --> 00:32:44
other side.
And then the homogeneous system

481
00:32:41 --> 00:32:47
is we will look in general how?
Well, we could write it out.

482
00:32:45 --> 00:32:51
It is going to look like a
minus lambda,

483
00:32:48 --> 00:32:54
b, c, d minus lambda.

484
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56
That is just how it looks there

485
00:32:53 --> 00:32:59
and the general calculation is
the same.

486
00:32:56 --> 00:33:02
Times (a1, a2) is equal to
zero.

487
00:33:00 --> 00:33:06

488
00:33:05 --> 00:33:11
This is solvable nontrivially.
In other words,

489
00:33:13 --> 00:33:19
it has a nontrivial solution if
an only if the determinant of

490
00:33:25 --> 00:33:31
coefficients is zero.

491
00:33:30 --> 00:33:36

492
00:33:35 --> 00:33:41
Let's now write that out,
calculate out once and for all

493
00:33:39 --> 00:33:45
what that determinant is.
I will write it out here.

494
00:33:43 --> 00:33:49
It is a minus lambda times d
minus lambda,

495
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
the product of the diagonal
elements, minus the

496
00:33:50 --> 00:33:56
anti-diagonal minus bc is equal
to zero.

497
00:33:55 --> 00:34:01
And let's calculate that out.

498
00:34:00 --> 00:34:06
It is lambda squared minus a
lambda minus d lambda plus ad,

499
00:34:07 --> 00:34:13
the constant term from here,
negative bc from there,

500
00:34:14 --> 00:34:20
plus ad minus bc,

501
00:34:21 --> 00:34:27
where have I seen that before?
This equation is the general

502
00:34:29 --> 00:34:35
form using letters of what we
calculated using the specific

503
00:34:36 --> 00:34:42
numbers before.
Again, I will code it the same

504
00:34:45 --> 00:34:51
way with that color salmon.
Now, most of the calculations

505
00:34:54 --> 00:35:00
will be for two-by-two systems.
I advise you,

506
00:35:00 --> 00:35:06
in the strongest possible
terms, to remember this

507
00:35:03 --> 00:35:09
equation.
You could write down this

508
00:35:06 --> 00:35:12
equation immediately for the
matrix.

509
00:35:08 --> 00:35:14
You don't have to go through
all this stuff.

510
00:35:11 --> 00:35:17
For God's sakes,
don't say let the trial

511
00:35:13 --> 00:35:19
solution be blah,
blah, blah.

512
00:35:15 --> 00:35:21
You don't want to do that.
I don't want you to repeat the

513
00:35:19 --> 00:35:25
derivation of this every time
you go through a particular

514
00:35:23 --> 00:35:29
problem.
It is just like in solving

515
00:35:25 --> 00:35:31
second order equations.
You have a second order

516
00:35:29 --> 00:35:35
equation.
You immediately write down its

517
00:35:32 --> 00:35:38
characteristic equation,
then you factor it,

518
00:35:35 --> 00:35:41
you find its roots and you
construct the solution.

519
00:35:39 --> 00:35:45
It takes a minute.
The same thing,

520
00:35:42 --> 00:35:48
this takes a minute,
too.

521
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
What is the constant term?
Ad minus bc,

522
00:35:47 --> 00:35:53
what is that?
Matrix is (a,

523
00:35:49 --> 00:35:55
b; c, d).
Ad minus bc is its determinant.

524
00:35:52 --> 00:35:58
This is the determinant of that
matrix.

525
00:35:55 --> 00:36:01
I didn't give the matrix a
name, did I?

526
00:36:00 --> 00:36:06
I will now give the matrix a
name A.

527
00:36:03 --> 00:36:09
What is this?
Well, you are not supposed to

528
00:36:07 --> 00:36:13
know that until now.
I will tell you.

529
00:36:10 --> 00:36:16
This is called the trace of A.
Put that down in your little

530
00:36:16 --> 00:36:22
books.
The abbreviation is trace A,

531
00:36:19 --> 00:36:25
and the word is trace.
The trace of a square matrix is

532
00:36:25 --> 00:36:31
the sum of the d elements down
its main diagonal.

533
00:36:31 --> 00:36:37
If it were a three-by-three
there would be three terms in

534
00:36:35 --> 00:36:41
whatever you are up to.
Here it is a plus b,

535
00:36:40 --> 00:36:46
the sum of the diagonal
elements.

536
00:36:43 --> 00:36:49
You can immediately write down
this characteristic equation.

537
00:36:48 --> 00:36:54
Let's give it a name.
This is a characteristic

538
00:36:52 --> 00:36:58
equation of what?
Of the matrix,

539
00:36:55 --> 00:37:01
now.
Not of the system,

540
00:36:57 --> 00:37:03
of the matrix.
You have a two-by-two matrix.

541
00:37:02 --> 00:37:08
You could immediately write
down its characteristic

542
00:37:06 --> 00:37:12
equation.
Watch out for this sign,

543
00:37:08 --> 00:37:14
minus.
That is a very common error to

544
00:37:11 --> 00:37:17
leave out the minus sign because
that is the way the formula

545
00:37:15 --> 00:37:21
comes out.
Its roots.

546
00:37:17 --> 00:37:23
If it is a quadratic equation
it will have roots;

547
00:37:20 --> 00:37:26
lambda1, lambda2 for the moment
let's assume are real and

548
00:37:25 --> 00:37:31
distinct.

549
00:37:27 --> 00:37:33

550
00:37:37 --> 00:37:43
For the enrichment of your
vocabulary, those are called the

551
00:37:39 --> 00:37:45
eigenvalues.

552
00:37:40 --> 00:37:46

553
00:37:50 --> 00:37:56
They are something which
belonged to the matrix A.

554
00:37:53 --> 00:37:59
They are two secret numbers.
You can calculate from the

555
00:37:56 --> 00:38:02
coefficients a,
b, and c, and d,

556
00:37:58 --> 00:38:04
but they are not in the
coefficients.

557
00:38:00 --> 00:38:06
You cannot look at a matrix and
see what its eigenvalues are.

558
00:38:05 --> 00:38:11
You have to calculate
something.

559
00:38:07 --> 00:38:13
But they are the most important
numbers in the matrix.

560
00:38:10 --> 00:38:16
They are hidden,
but they are the things that

561
00:38:13 --> 00:38:19
control how this system behaves.
Those are called the

562
00:38:17 --> 00:38:23
eigenvalues.
Now, there are various purists,

563
00:38:20 --> 00:38:26
there are a fair number of them
in the world who do not like

564
00:38:24 --> 00:38:30
this word because it begins
German and ends English.

565
00:38:29 --> 00:38:35
Eigenvalues were first
introduced by a German

566
00:38:32 --> 00:38:38
mathematician,
you know, around the time

567
00:38:35 --> 00:38:41
matrices came into being in 
or so.

568
00:38:38 --> 00:38:44
A little while after
eigenvalues came into being,

569
00:38:41 --> 00:38:47
too.
And since all this happened in

570
00:38:44 --> 00:38:50
Germany they were named
eigenvalues in German,

571
00:38:47 --> 00:38:53
which begins eigen and ends
value.

572
00:38:50 --> 00:38:56
But people who do not like that
call them the characteristic

573
00:38:54 --> 00:39:00
values.
Unfortunately,

574
00:38:56 --> 00:39:02
it is two words and takes a lot
more space to write out.

575
00:39:02 --> 00:39:08
An older generation even calls
them something different,

576
00:39:06 --> 00:39:12
which you are not so likely to
see nowadays,

577
00:39:10 --> 00:39:16
but you will in slightly older
books.

578
00:39:13 --> 00:39:19
You can also call them the
proper values.

579
00:39:17 --> 00:39:23
Characteristic is not a
translation of eigen,

580
00:39:21 --> 00:39:27
but proper is,
but it means it in a funny

581
00:39:25 --> 00:39:31
sense which has almost
disappeared nowadays.

582
00:39:30 --> 00:39:36
It means proper in the sense of
belong to.

583
00:39:33 --> 00:39:39
The only example I can think of
is the word property.

584
00:39:37 --> 00:39:43
Property is something that
belongs to you.

585
00:39:40 --> 00:39:46
That is the use of the word
proper.

586
00:39:43 --> 00:39:49
It is something that belongs to
the matrix.

587
00:39:46 --> 00:39:52
The matrix has its proper
values.

588
00:39:49 --> 00:39:55
It does not mean proper in the
sense of fitting and proper or I

589
00:39:54 --> 00:40:00
hope you will behave properly
when we go to Aunt Agatha's or

590
00:39:59 --> 00:40:05
something like that.
But, as I say,

591
00:40:03 --> 00:40:09
by far the most popular thing,
slowly the word eigenvalue is

592
00:40:07 --> 00:40:13
pretty much taking over the
literature.

593
00:40:11 --> 00:40:17
Just because it's just one
word, that is a tremendous

594
00:40:15 --> 00:40:21
advantage.
Okay.

595
00:40:16 --> 00:40:22
What now is still to be done?
Well, there are those vectors

596
00:40:21 --> 00:40:27
to be found.
So the very last step would be

597
00:40:24 --> 00:40:30
to solve the system to find the
vectors a1 and a2.

598
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36

599
00:40:35 --> 00:40:41
For each (lambda)i,
find the associated vector.

600
00:40:40 --> 00:40:46
The vector, we will call it
(alpha)i.

601
00:40:44 --> 00:40:50
That is the a1 and a2.
Of course it's going to be

602
00:40:50 --> 00:40:56
indexed.
You have to put another

603
00:40:53 --> 00:40:59
subscript on it because there
are two of them.

604
00:41:00 --> 00:41:06
And a1 and a2 is stretched a
little too far.

605
00:41:04 --> 00:41:10
By solving the system,
and the system will be the

606
00:41:09 --> 00:41:15
system which I will write this
way, (a minus lambda,

607
00:41:15 --> 00:41:21
b, c, d minus lambda).

608
00:41:19 --> 00:41:25
It is just that system that was

609
00:41:24 --> 00:41:30
over there, but I will recopy
it, (a1, a2) equals zero,

610
00:41:30 --> 00:41:36
zero.
And these are called the

611
00:41:34 --> 00:41:40
eigenvectors.
Each of these is called the

612
00:41:39 --> 00:41:45
eigenvector associated with or
belonging to,

613
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
again, in that sense of
property.

614
00:41:48 --> 00:41:54
Eigenvector,
let's say belonging to,

615
00:41:52 --> 00:41:58
I see that a little more
frequently, belonging to lambda

616
00:41:58 --> 00:42:04
i.
So we have the eigenvalues,

617
00:42:01 --> 00:42:07
the eigenvectors and,
of course, the people who call

618
00:42:04 --> 00:42:10
them characteristic values also
call these guys characteristic

619
00:42:08 --> 00:42:14
vectors.
I don't think I have ever seen

620
00:42:11 --> 00:42:17
proper vectors,
but that is because I am not

621
00:42:13 --> 00:42:19
old enough.
I think that is what they used

622
00:42:16 --> 00:42:22
to be called a long time ago,
but not anymore.

623
00:42:20 --> 00:42:26
And then, finally,
the general solution will be,

624
00:42:24 --> 00:42:30
by the superposition principle,
(x, y) equals the arbitrary

625
00:42:30 --> 00:42:36
constant times the first
eigenvector times the eigenvalue

626
00:42:35 --> 00:42:41
times the e to the corresponding
eigenvalue.

627
00:42:40 --> 00:42:46
And then the same thing for the
second one, (a1,

628
00:42:44 --> 00:42:50
a2), but now the second index
will be 2 to indicate that it

629
00:42:50 --> 00:42:56
goes with the eigenvalue e to
the lambda 2t.

630
00:42:56 --> 00:43:02
I have done that twice.
And now in the remaining five

631
00:43:02 --> 00:43:08
minutes I will do it a third
time because it is possible to

632
00:43:06 --> 00:43:12
write this in still a more
condensed form.

633
00:43:09 --> 00:43:15
And the advantage of the more
condensed form is A,

634
00:43:13 --> 00:43:19
it takes only that much space
to write, and B,

635
00:43:16 --> 00:43:22
it applies to systems,
not just the two-by-two

636
00:43:20 --> 00:43:26
systems, but to end-by-end
systems.

637
00:43:23 --> 00:43:29
The method is exactly the same.
Let's write it out as it would

638
00:43:27 --> 00:43:33
apply to end-by-end systems.
The vector I started with is

639
00:43:34 --> 00:43:40
(x, y) and so on,
but I will simply abbreviate

640
00:43:39 --> 00:43:45
this, as is done in 18.02,
by x with an arrow over it.

641
00:43:45 --> 00:43:51
The matrix A I will abbreviate
with A, as I did before with

642
00:43:51 --> 00:43:57
capital A.
And then the system looks like

643
00:43:56 --> 00:44:02
x prime is equal to --

644
00:44:00 --> 00:44:06

645
00:44:05 --> 00:44:11
x prime is what?
Ax.

646
00:44:06 --> 00:44:12
That is all there is to it.

647
00:44:10 --> 00:44:16
There is our green system.
Now notice in this form I did

648
00:44:15 --> 00:44:21
not even tell you whether this a
two-by-two matrix or an

649
00:44:20 --> 00:44:26
end-by-end.
And in this condensed form it

650
00:44:23 --> 00:44:29
will look the same no matter how
many equations you have.

651
00:44:30 --> 00:44:36
Your book deals from the
beginning with end-by-end

652
00:44:33 --> 00:44:39
systems.
That is, in my view,

653
00:44:36 --> 00:44:42
one of its weaknesses because I
don't think most students start

654
00:44:40 --> 00:44:46
with two-by-two.
Fortunately,

655
00:44:43 --> 00:44:49
the book double-talks.
The theory is end-by-end,

656
00:44:46 --> 00:44:52
but all the examples are
two-by-two.

657
00:44:49 --> 00:44:55
So just read the examples.
Read the notes instead,

658
00:44:53 --> 00:44:59
which just do two-by-two to
start out with.

659
00:44:58 --> 00:45:04
The trial solution is x equals
what?

660
00:45:01 --> 00:45:07
An unknown vector alpha times e
to the lambda t.

661
00:45:07 --> 00:45:13
Alpha is what we called a1 and

662
00:45:11 --> 00:45:17
a2 before.
Plug this into there and cancel

663
00:45:15 --> 00:45:21
the e to the lambda t's.

664
00:45:19 --> 00:45:25
What do you get?
Well, this is lambda alpha e to

665
00:45:24 --> 00:45:30
the lambda t equals A alpha e to
the lambda t.

666
00:45:29 --> 00:45:35

667
00:45:36 --> 00:45:42
These two cancel.
And the system to be solved,

668
00:45:40 --> 00:45:46
A alpha equals lambda alpha.

669
00:45:46 --> 00:45:52
And now the question is how do
you solve that system?

670
00:45:51 --> 00:45:57
Well, you can tell if a book is
written by a scoundrel or not by

671
00:45:57 --> 00:46:03
how they go --
A book, which is in my opinion

672
00:46:02 --> 00:46:08
completely scoundrel,
simply says you subtract one

673
00:46:07 --> 00:46:13
from the other,
and without further ado writes

674
00:46:12 --> 00:46:18
A minus lambda,
and they tuck a little I in

675
00:46:16 --> 00:46:22
there and write alpha equals
zero.

676
00:46:19 --> 00:46:25
Why is the I put in there?
Well, this is what you would

677
00:46:25 --> 00:46:31
like to write.
What is wrong with this

678
00:46:28 --> 00:46:34
equation?
This is not a valid matrix

679
00:46:32 --> 00:46:38
equation because that is a
square end-by-end matrix,

680
00:46:36 --> 00:46:42
a square two-by-two matrix if
you like.

681
00:46:39 --> 00:46:45
This is a scalar.
You cannot subtract the scalar

682
00:46:42 --> 00:46:48
from a matrix.
It is not an operation.

683
00:46:45 --> 00:46:51
To subtract matrices they have
to be the same size,

684
00:46:49 --> 00:46:55
the same shape.
What is done is you make this a

685
00:46:52 --> 00:46:58
two-by-two matrix.
This is a two-by-two matrix

686
00:46:56 --> 00:47:02
with lambdas down the main
diagonal and I elsewhere.

687
00:47:01 --> 00:47:07
And the justification is that
lambda alpha is the same thing

688
00:47:05 --> 00:47:11
as the lambda I times alpha
because I is an identity matrix.

689
00:47:10 --> 00:47:16
Now, in fact,
jumping from here to here is

690
00:47:13 --> 00:47:19
not something that would occur
to anybody.

691
00:47:16 --> 00:47:22
The way it should occur to you
to do this is you do this,

692
00:47:21 --> 00:47:27
you write that,
you realize it doesn't work,

693
00:47:24 --> 00:47:30
and then you say to yourself I
don't understand what these

694
00:47:29 --> 00:47:35
matrices are all about.
I think I'd better write it all

695
00:47:33 --> 00:47:39
out.
And then you would write it all

696
00:47:36 --> 00:47:42
out and you would write that
equation on the left-hand board

697
00:47:39 --> 00:47:45
there.
Oh, now I see what it should

698
00:47:41 --> 00:47:47
look like.
I should subtract lambda from

699
00:47:44 --> 00:47:50
the main diagonal.
That is the way it will come

700
00:47:47 --> 00:47:53
out.
And then say,

701
00:47:48 --> 00:47:54
hey, the way to save lambda
from the main diagonal is put it

702
00:47:51 --> 00:47:57
in an identity matrix.
That will do it for me.

703
00:47:54 --> 00:48:00
In other words,
there is a little detour that

704
00:47:57 --> 00:48:03
goes from here to here.
And one of the ways I judge

705
00:48:01 --> 00:48:07
books is by how well they
explain the passage from this to

706
00:48:05 --> 00:48:11
that.
If they don't explain it at all

707
00:48:08 --> 00:48:14
and just write it down,
they have never talked to

708
00:48:11 --> 00:48:17
students.
They have just written books.

709
00:48:14 --> 00:48:20
Where did we get finally here?
The characteristic equation

710
00:48:17 --> 00:48:23
from that, I had forgotten what
color.

711
00:48:20 --> 00:48:26
That is in salmon.
The characteristic equation,

712
00:48:23 --> 00:48:29
then, is going to be the thing
which says that the determinant

713
00:48:27 --> 00:48:33
of that is zero.
That is the circumstances under

714
00:48:32 --> 00:48:38
which it is solvable.
In general, this is the way the

715
00:48:35 --> 00:48:41
characteristic equation looks.
And its roots,

716
00:48:38 --> 00:48:44
once again, are the
eigenvalues.

717
00:48:40 --> 00:48:46
And from then you calculate the
corresponding eigenvectors.

718
00:48:44 --> 00:48:50
Okay.
Go home and practice.

719
00:48:46 --> 00:48:52
In recitation you will practice
on both two-by-two and

720
00:48:50 --> 00:48:56
three-by-three cases,
and we will talk more next

721
00:48:53 --> 00:48:59
time.
