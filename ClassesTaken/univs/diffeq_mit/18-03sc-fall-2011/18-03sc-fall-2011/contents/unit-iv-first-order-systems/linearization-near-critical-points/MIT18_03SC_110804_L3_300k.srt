00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:09,190
PROFESSOR: Welcome to this
presentation on linearization.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,250
So here we consider a
prey-predator system, where we

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,990
have x dot equals x, factorizing
3 minus x minus

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,230
xy, and y dot equals y
factorizing 1 minus y plus xy.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,520
So here we can see that x is
the prey, because y is

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,060
basically feeding on it.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,330
And y is the predator, because
feeding on x gives a growth of

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,490
the predator species, y.

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,080
So here, because it's a
prey-predator system, x and y

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,530
are assumed to be positive.

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,700
So you're asked to interpret
even further this system and

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,430
to find the critical points,
linearize and sketch the phase

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,190
portrait and then discuss what
your linearization tells you

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,010
about the behavior
of this system.

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,530
So why don't you pause the video
and take a few minutes

17
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,080
to do that.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,330
I'll be right back.

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,560

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,260
Welcome back.

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,310
So I helped you already for
the first question.

22
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,610
We interpreted that x was the
prey and y was the predator.

23
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,190
The other thing that you could
see is that this term here is

24
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,590
basic logistic growth.

25
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,710
So if we didn't have the
predator species around, this

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,340
species x of prey would just
grow and eventually reach a

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,470
value that corresponds to
the saturation level.

28
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,300
And if we started with a lot of
prey, then eventually they

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,720
would die off and go back to
that same carrying capacity

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,300
value of prey in that
environment.

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,950
Same thing here for
the predator.

32
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,280
We have a logistic growth,
with different growth

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,950
coefficients.

34
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,100
And again, if we didn't have the
prey around, we would just

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,940
have a logistic dynamic for
this species on its own.

36
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,060
But with the prey, we have
a growth of this species.

37
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,440
So that basically ends
the first part.

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,760
For the second part, we need to
find the critical points.

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,250
So how do we find the
critical points?

40
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,590
The critical points correspond
to basically f

41
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,090
and g equals to 0.

42
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,380
So f equal to 0 equals to g.

43
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,750
You see from f equals to 0
that we can have either x

44
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,300
equals 0, if we factorize the
x on both terms, and if x is

45
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:29,660
not equal to 0, then we end up
with y equals to 3 minus x.

46
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,100
For the second part, we can also
here, if g equals to 0,

47
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,790
factorize y.

48
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:42,490
And we get either y equals to 0,
or we have that x is equal

49
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,700
to y minus 1, where I
just bring that term

50
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,460
to the other hand.

51
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,080
So the critical point would be
either of these two entries.

52
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,650

53
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,130
It would be, for example, x
equals to 0 and this entry,

54
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,600
which would give us y equals
to 1, or we would have y

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,790
equals to 0, and then this
entry would give

56
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,340
us x equals to 3.

57
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,870
And then the last combined case,
where we have these two

58
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:19,340
entries, which corresponds
to 1 and 2, if you do it.

59
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,470
So let's look now at the
stability of the linearization

60
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,210
of the system around each one
of these critical points.

61
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,260
So what do we do to linearize
the system?

62
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,040
Very quickly, we need to compute
the Jacobian around

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,140
each critical point-- and we're
just going to build a

64
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,260
table after to do that--

65
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,940
where we basically have f, a
derivative of f around x,

66
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,390
derivative of g around x,
derivative of f around y,

67
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,730
derivative of g around y,
all this evaluated at

68
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,980
the critical point.

69
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,610

70
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,300
And this corresponds to
basically linearizing our

71
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,510
nonlinear system, because you
see here that there are a lot

72
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,350
of nonlinear systems, and
studying the stability around

73
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,290
the neighborhood of the critical
point, like if it was

74
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,990
basically linear around there.

75
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,050
This method has its limitations,
and we'll discuss

76
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,070
them later.

77
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,810
So first I'm going to just here
give you the results of

78
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,630
computation that I did earlier,
where basically you

79
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,670
can repeat this computation.

80
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,780
But I don't want to spend
too much time

81
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,690
with the algebra here.

82
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,065
So we have four critical
points.

83
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:36,410

84
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:43,440
(0,0), (0,1), (3,0),
and (1,2).

85
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,160
So this is going to
just replace the

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,300
values for the Jacobian.

87
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,020
So here you compute basically
the derivative of f of x with

88
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,660
respect to x.

89
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,990
And you evaluate this at then
the value of (0,0).

90
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,260
And so that would give
you (3,0) (0,1).

91
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,870
For this case, same thing.

92
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,490
We have the expression
for the Jacobian.

93
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,890
We evaluate it at critical
point (0,1).

94
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,670
And that gives us
(2,0) (1,-1).

95
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,120
For this one similarly,
we evaluate

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,370
the Jacobian at (3,0).

97
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,020
And we get this Jacobian
value.

98
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,560
And for this last critical
point, we have

99
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,490
this Jacobian value.

100
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,100
So now what's next?

101
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,370
So the Jacobian basically gives
us the expression around

102
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,320
the critical point to look at
the system, like if it was

103
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,100
linear around there.

104
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,750
So from this point, we're back
to the linear methods we

105
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,570
learned before.

106
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,560
We need to compute the
eigenvalues of the Jacobian

107
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,450
around each critical point,
and then determine the

108
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,460
structure around each critical
point of the structure of

109
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,110
basically the phase portrait.

110
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,405
So what are the eigenvalues?

111
00:05:56,405 --> 00:06:00,900

112
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,730
The eigenvalues are (3,1), and
you can compute that and

113
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,595
verify for yourself.

114
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:11,185

115
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:18,260
Plus or minus root of 7pi and
the whole thing over 2.

116
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,760
So here basically,
we have two real

117
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,860
eigenvalues, both positive.

118
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,480
So we're going to have,
basically, an instability,

119
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,990
unstable node.

120
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,090
And it's just basically the
local stability around the

121
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,190
critical point.

122
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,740
Here we would have this one
positive, one negative.

123
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:42,560
So this is a saddle, which
would be unstable.

124
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,130
The (-3,4) would give
us another saddle.

125
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:52,940

126
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,640
And these complex eigenvalues
would basically give us a

127
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:05,170
spiral with the real part going
to 0, with the real part

128
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,790
being negative.

129
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:12,660
So a spiral that's stable
and [? symbiotical ?].

130
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,730
So let's just do the
diagram here.

131
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,945
And I'll continue
the discussion.

132
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:23,160

133
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,730
So let's consider only the
case where x and y are

134
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,560
positive, because we're talking
about populations.

135
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,650
And let's place our
critical points.

136
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,150
So we have a first critical
points here at (0,0).

137
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,590
We have a second critical
point here at (0,1).

138
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,590
We have a third critical point
at (3,0), and the last

139
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,260
critical points at basically
(1,2), or

140
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,674
something around there.

141
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:55,550

142
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,490
So now, based on the information
we have on this

143
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,320
table, we have the
eigenvalues.

144
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,160
We could also compute the
corresponding eigenvectors.

145
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,660
And you can compute that.

146
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,720
And I'm not going to get into
the details here, but

147
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,830
basically the values of the
eigenvectors would be

148
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,320
important to give you,
for example, the

149
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,950
direction of your spiral.

150
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,880
But we will do that on
the diagram as we go.

151
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,650
So here at the (0,0) point
is an unstable node.

152
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,370
So basically, the solutions are
going away from this point

153
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,770
in the x and y.

154
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,409
This point, (0,1) is a saddle.

155
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,659
So we basically are
on the ray here.

156
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,770
You would compute that the
eigenvector that corresponds

157
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,200
to this negative eigenvalue
would actually be in the

158
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,360
direction (0,1) and would
converge toward this solution.

159
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,260
And you can compute that
the other eigenvector

160
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,620
corresponding to the eigenvalue
2 would have a

161
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,630
direction this form.

162
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,340
So here we neglect what's
happening here, but it would

163
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,710
be in this direction.

164
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,590
And the solutions would
be basically

165
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,010
going away from here.

166
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:20,990
And we would have locally
something like that.

167
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:27,510
For this point, which
corresponds to an unstable

168
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,960
mode, basically the solution
would be going away.

169
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,240
For this point, which
corresponds to (3,0), we have

170
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,610
a saddle again, which
is unstable.

171
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,460
And here you can compute that
the eigenvector corresponding

172
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,200
to the negative eigenvalue would
basically be parallel to

173
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,970
the x-axis.

174
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,790
So it would have coordinates
(1,0).

175
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,230
And the eigenvector
corresponding to the

176
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,700
eigenvalue 4 would be directed
in this direction.

177
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,250
And basically, the solution
would be fleeing from there.

178
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,680
So locally, we would have
something like that, like we

179
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,110
did before.

180
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,840

181
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,330
So we'll complete the graph.

182
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,840
Now, let's focus on the last
critical point, (1,2).

183
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,000
So this point corresponds
to a spiral.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,660
And it's a stable spiral --

185
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,040
asymptotically stable, because
these eigenvalue's negative.

186
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,080
So the solutions are going
toward this point.

187
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,660
And you can look at the lower
entry here of the matrix,

188
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,740
which is positive, which means
that we would be going

189
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,070
counterclockwise.

190
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:42,780
So we would have something there
would be looking like

191
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:49,260
this, going toward this point.

192
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,490
So that's roughly what we
would have for the three

193
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,900
critical points.

194
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,150
Am I missing one?

195
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,970

196
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,450
For the four critical points.

197
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,600
And so now we can complete our
diagram by basically linking

198
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,900
to different localized phase
portraits together.

199
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,410
And so what will we have here?

200
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,620
So for example, we would have a
solution here that would be

201
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,600
escaping, if we start in this
neighborhood, would be

202
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,410
escaping from this
critical point.

203
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,690
But then eventually, it would
get attracted by this other

204
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,510
critical point, which when
it enters its basin of

205
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,850
attraction, given that it's
symptotically stable would be

206
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,690
attracted by it and go here.

207
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,060
If we started from a very high
y value, we would be going

208
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,350
down and then eventually getting
close to this critical

209
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,290
point that would then basically
cause this directory

210
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,500
to, again, escape and go feed
this spiral by reaching the

211
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,190
basin of attraction
of this point.

212
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:56,370
If we look at the critical point
(3,0), then if we start

213
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,210
with a population x that is
very large and we approach

214
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,320
this point, then we would have
a solution that basically

215
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,480
would eventually continue
parallel to this ray of the

216
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,560
unstable part of the critical
point (3,0), follow this ray

217
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,580
and eventually basically just
be far more parallel to this

218
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,886
trajectory that links this
linear (3,0), critical point

219
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:27,570
to the (1,2) critical point.

220
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,950
And so we can complete
the diagram by having

221
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,700
something like this.

222
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,230
Now for this point,
what do we have?

223
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,470
So for this point, we also have
the solutions that would

224
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:44,320
be basically fleeting from the
point (0,0), and eventually

225
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,810
could be attracted to
the spiral as well.

226
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,550
So that we give us then
something like this, a

227
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,080
trajectory that would be
looking like that And

228
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,220
basically these trajectories
would be looking like that.

229
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,150
And I'm not going to complete
the parts where y and x are

230
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,430
not positive.

231
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,310
So we can complete the phase
diagram of this nonlinear

232
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,490
system in this way.

233
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,250
So now, how do we
interpret this?

234
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,250
What does this mean?

235
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,790
Well, if we remind ourselves
of what this is actually

236
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,230
modeling, and if we just look
at, for example, the different

237
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,060
axes, what does the y equals
0, x equals 0 point mean?

238
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,850
It means that basically we have
0 population of prey, 0

239
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,790
of predator.

240
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,520
And so it makes sense that we
have basically an unstable

241
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,160
point here, an unstable critical
point, because as

242
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,200
soon as we add one prey or one
predator, we would have an

243
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
increase of the prey population,
eventually the

244
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,220
predator would grow, and so we
would have a solution that

245
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,620
basically escapes the
area around the

246
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,110
critical point (0,0).

247
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,960
What would happen if we just
looked at the axis y equals to

248
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,440
0? y equals to 0 corresponds
to dynamics where we don't

249
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,130
have the predator population.

250
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,820
So the prey is just
leaving its life,

251
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,490
growing at logistic growth.

252
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,410
And so basically, it's attracted
by the carrying

253
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,880
capacity that would
be here set at 3.

254
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,590
And so if we start with a lot
of prey, eventually they die

255
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,510
out until they reach
population 3.

256
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,400
And if we start with not enough,
they grow and they

257
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,170
reach population 3, without
the predator around.

258
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,300
Same thing for the predator
on its own.

259
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,820
Now if we put the two together
then we have a spiral, which

260
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,070
means that we have
oscillation.

261
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,190

262
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,570
If we have a lot of predators,
we have very few prey.

263
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,030
And eventually the predators
start dying off as well.

264
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,310
But then, because they start
dying off, the prey population

265
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,580
starts increasing, which
then gives an

266
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,280
increase of the predator.

267
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,680
So we get, eventually, an
oscillation that goes to this

268
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,630
attractor, (1,2), where the
system will stabilize

269
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,440
eventually, where we would have,
basically, one prey for

270
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,530
two predators.

271
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,790
So that ends the interpretation
of the system.

272
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:13,090
And the idea here was to
basically use what we learned

273
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:17,270
for the linear systems, in terms
of the phase portrait,

274
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,630
and to see how we can apply that
to the nonlinear cases,

275
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,070
after linearlizing the system
around each one of the

276
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,100
critical points.

277
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,040
What I should also mention
here is that in all these

278
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,510
cases that we looked at,
we had cases that were

279
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:36,600
structurally stable, which means
that in our determinant

280
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,480
trace diagram, we weren't at
any borderline case where a

281
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,730
little perturbation could make
the structure around the

282
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,780
critical point change
radically.

283
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,810
So all these points are
structurally stable, and the

284
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,070
linearization therefore
is valid around them.

285
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,320
And that ends this recitation.

286
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,708
