DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,920
So today I'd like to take a
look at linear equations,

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,690
linear first order differential
equations.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,280
And specifically, we're going to
look at just exactly, what

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,440
is a linear equation?

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,430
So for example, which of these
equations are linear?

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,630
And then second of all, we're
going to take a look at

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,090
superposition.

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,890
And we ask to consider the
differential equation y dot

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,550
plus y squared equals some
function q of t.

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,640
And just to demonstrate that
this equation does not satisfy

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,580
the superposition principle.

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,670
So I'll let you take a look at
this problem, and try and work

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,640
it out for yourself.

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,890
And I'll be back in a minute.

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:54,444

18
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:55,610
Hi, everyone.

19
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,160
Welcome back.

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,350
All right.

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,320
So we're asked to figure
out which of these

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,010
equations are linear.

23
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,060
So just to recap, what
does it mean for an

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,120
equation to be linear?

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,910
What does it mean for a first
order equation to be linear?

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,740
Well, it means that we can write
it in the general form.

27
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:24,220
So if it's a function
of dy dx plus some

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,400
general function of x.

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,690
And this could be anything.

30
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,862
But the point is that it's
multiplied just by y.

31
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:32,570

32
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,480
And then it can equal some
arbitrary function q of x on

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,230
the right-hand side.

34
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,440
So every first order linear
equation can be

35
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,690
rewritten in this form.

36
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,640

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,130
So let's tackle part A. All
right, y dot plus ky equals--

38
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,470
or y dot equals ky.

39
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:57,410
We can just rewrite it as y
dot equals negative ky.

40
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:02,120
Note that just some constant
k is a function of time.

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,900
It's a constant function of
time, but it can just be

42
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,870
thought of as a function
of time.

43
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,790
Same with the right-hand
side, it's 0.

44
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,550
And so this equation has the
same form as our general first

45
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,320
order linear equation.

46
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,100
So this is a linear equation.

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,540
Let's take a look at
question 2, part 2.

48
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,810
We have y dot plus
y squared t.

49
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,770
I'll bring the y to the
left-hand side.

50
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,990
If we do that, we get this.

51
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,730
And just by comparing this to
our generic first order linear

52
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,750
ODE, we note that it's
not of this form.

53
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,570
So specifically, this is the
bad term in question.

54
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,960
We see that it's y
squared times t.

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,620
Notice how we're not allowed
to have any term that's y

56
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,730
squared in our first order
linear equation.

57
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,345
Now I will say this
just as an aside.

58
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:59,000

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,810
This equation's also known
as a Bernoulli equation.

60
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,160
And as an aside, if you were
to make a substitution u

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,380
equals 1/y, and rewrote this
equation in terms of u as the

62
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,490
independent variable.

63
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,230
You'd find out that this
equation would be linear in

64
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,855
terms of u.

65
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:21,820
But as it's written now in terms
of y, it's not linear.

66
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,200
So this is a kind of an
interesting point.

67
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,980
That sometimes we can get
lucky and do a nonlinear

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,190
transformation and convert a
nonlinear equation into a

69
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,440
linear one.

70
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,020

71
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:49,560
So for part 3 we have y prime
plus cos x y equals x cubed.

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,190
So again, we see that this is
a linear equation because we

73
00:03:52,190 --> 00:04:02,840
can identify p of x with cosine
x, q of x with x cubed.

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,455
So this equation has the general
form of a linear ODE.

75
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:10,260

76
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,320
For part 4, well if we take a
look at it right away, y dot

77
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,640
divided by y is equal
to t squared.

78
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,740
It doesn't appear
to be linear.

79
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,200
But of course, we can
multiply through by

80
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,820
y and rewrite things.

81
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,430

82
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,220
And of course, this equation is
equivalent to y dot minus t

83
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,160
squared y equals 0.

84
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,580
Which again, is linear because
p of t can be identified with

85
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,120
negative t squared and q of t
can be identified with 0.

86
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:58,470
And then lastly, for part 5,
we have x squared y y prime

87
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,780
plus 4x equals x cubed.

88
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,320

89
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,880
And again, if we were to try
to write it in the general

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:23,460
form of a linear ODE, which we
have here, it would look like

91
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:30,130
4x divided by x squared y minus
x cubed divided by x

92
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,500
squared y equals 0.

93
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,720
And because there's a y on the
denominator here, this

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,760
equation doesn't have the
general form of a first order

95
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,030
linear equation.

96
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:48,250
Now again, I note that if you
were to make a substitution, u

97
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,720
equal to y squared, that
substitution would make this

98
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,970
equation linear.

99
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,870

100
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,120
So this concludes part a.

101
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,980

102
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,480
So for part b, we're given a
differential equation y dot

103
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,720
plus y squared is
equal to q of t.

104
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,290
And we want to show that this
equation doesn't satisfy the

105
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,360
superposition principle.

106
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,030
Now, you might note that this
equation is not linear.

107
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,150
And second of all, we know that
linear equations satisfy

108
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,400
the superposition principle.

109
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,210

110
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,840
So we need to exploit the fact
that it's a nonlinear equation

111
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,410
to make it fail the
superposition principle.

112
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,050
And just as an example, what we
can do is I can just pick a

113
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,980
couple right-hand side's q
as examples of this ODE.

114
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,790
So we can imagine we have a
solution y1 which solves the

115
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:57,060
ODE y 1 dot plus y1
squared equals--

116
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,610
I'm just going to say 1 on
the right-hand side.

117
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,050
And I can also take another
function y2, which say

118
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,500
satisfies this differential
equation, say t.

119
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,120
So all I've done is I've just
picked one q1 on the

120
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,860
right-hand side and another
function q2.

121
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,760
And I imagined that I have a
solution y1 which satisfies

122
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,190
this differential equation and
y2 which satisfies this

123
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,670
differential equation.

124
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,680
So what does the superposition
principle say?

125
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:40,020
Well, superposition says that if
y1 solves this equation and

126
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:48,150
y2 solves this equation, then
the function y equals y1 plus

127
00:07:48,150 --> 00:08:00,010
y2 must solve the equation y dot
plus y squared equals the

128
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,400
sum of the right-hand
side, 1 plus t.

129
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,370
So if we try and substitute in
y1 plus y2 into this equation,

130
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,520
we're going to come to
a contradiction.

131
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,160
So let's do that now.

132
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,960
So we take d by dt of y1 plus
y2, and I'm going to add it to

133
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,200
y1 plus y2 quantity squared.

134
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,490

135
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,620
And now what I can do is I
can just simplify this.

136
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,630
So I get y1 dot plus y2 dot.

137
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,350
And I can expand out
this square.

138
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:48,880
So I get y1 squared plus y2
squared plus 2 y1 y2.

139
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,550
And now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to combine the

140
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,550
term y1 with y1 squared.

141
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,490
And by construction, y1 dot plus
y1 squared is equal to 1,

142
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,480
because I assumed that
it satisfied this

143
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,020
differential equation.

144
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,940
And then in addition by
construction, y2 dot plus y2

145
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,600
squared satisfies the right-hand
side of the second

146
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,340
equation with t.

147
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,160

148
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,390
So I get 1 plus t, but I'm
left over with this other

149
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,040
piece 2 y1 y2.

150
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,120

151
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,600
So in general, if I take a
function which solves this

152
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,100
differential equation and
another function which solves

153
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,810
this differential equation, and
I add them together, and

154
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,620
plug it into the left-hand
side of this differential

155
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,910
equation, I get something which
is 1 plus t plus some

156
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,750
other stuff.

157
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:58,680
And if it did satisfy the
principle of superposition, it

158
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,710
must equal 1 plus t.

159
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,460
So we arrive at a contradiction
because it

160
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,830
doesn't equal 1 plus t.

161
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:11,460
In fact, it fails to equal 1
plus t by this term 2 y1 y2.

162
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,200
And this term comes directly
from the fact that we had a

163
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,460
nonlinearity in the equation.

164
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,450
So this is just one illustration
of the fact that

165
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,020
a nonlinear equation doesn't
necessarily satisfy the

166
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,270
superposition principle.

167
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,730
Whereas, every linear equation
satisfies the

168
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,130
superposition principle.

169
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,210
This is one reason we love
linear equations and we study

170
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,760
them extensively.

171
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,320
OK, so I'd just like
to conclude here.

172
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
And I'll see you next time.

173
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,570
