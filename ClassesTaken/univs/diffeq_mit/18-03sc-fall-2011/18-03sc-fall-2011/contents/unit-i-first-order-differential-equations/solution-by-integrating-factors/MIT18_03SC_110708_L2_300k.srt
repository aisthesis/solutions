00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,350

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,060
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,480
In this session, we're going
to tackle initial value

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,510
problem, y dot plus
ty equals to t.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,000
And this initial value problem
is going to be subject to the

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,030
initial condition, y
of 0 equals to 3.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:26,760
We are going to use the method
of integration factor.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,170

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:42,330
And what I want you to use is
both definite integrals and

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,580
indefinite integrals.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:51,010

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,990
So why don't you take
a few minutes to

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,990
think about the problem?

14
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,730
And we will be right back.

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,370

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,280
Welcome back.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,850
So I hope that you worked out
the first part of the problem.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,780
So what are we going to
do to solve this ODE.

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,560
First, we need to review
what is the method

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,200
of integrating factor.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,600
So when we use the integrating
factor, basically, we're

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,750
trying to write down our ODE
in a different form by

23
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,110
introducing a function u.

24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,450
And the goal is to find the
function u such that we can

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,540
rewrite this left-hand side
as the derivative of the

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,130
product y dot u.

27
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,600
So in this case, if we're
looking at identifying the

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,040
function u that would give us
this form, yu dot, we need to

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,530
just basically identify
that this is u dot.

30
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,360

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,150
And from previous sessions, we
saw that this would give us

32
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:09,610
classical solution that involves
an exponential of the

33
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:15,960
integral of the right-hand
side after dividing by u,

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,980
which gives us exponential
of t squared over 2.

35
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,720
So integrating factor is just
using a trick so that we

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,700
simplify our left-hand side and
write it in the form of

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,120
the derivative of
the product, yu.

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,690
So now, we identified our
integration factor.

39
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,570
It's u equals exponential
of t squared over 2.

40
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,730
Now, we can go back
to our equation.

41
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,050
And I'm going to just label
it with a star here.

42
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:54,550
So now, this equation is written
in this form, t, and

43
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,130
the integral of just basically
derivative, which is itself.

44
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,640
So if we use first the
approach of definite

45
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,620
integrals--

46
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,500
actually, we're going to switch
the order, and I'm

47
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,240
going to start with indefinite
integrals first.

48
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,340
So using indefinite integrals,
we'll be

49
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,895
integrating both sides.

50
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:17,510

51
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:25,420
And on the left-hand side, we
would just be left with yu,

52
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,520
remembering that u is just
exponential of t

53
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,460
squared over 2.

54
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,035
On the right-hand side, we're
just integrating t exponential

55
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:34,500
of t squared over 2.

56
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,600
And here, you can recognize
that the derivative of

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,890
exponential of t squared
over 2 would have a

58
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,710
t in front of it.

59
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,500
So this is actually a very
simple integration.

60
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,450

61
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,020
But we are in the case of
differential equation where we

62
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,550
need a constant of
integration.

63
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,980
And again, here, we would end
up with two constants of

64
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,160
integration on both sides.

65
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,330
But given that we are dealing
with a first order

66
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,310
differential equation, we can
regroup that in one constant.

67
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,080
And then, we can just find our
solution by dividing this

68
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,950
equation by u.

69
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,020
And u, if you remember, is just
exponential of t squared

70
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,450
over 2, so it's equivalent to
multiplying both sides by

71
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,050
exponential of minus
t squared over 2.

72
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,430
So I'm just going to
write it down.

73
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:27,090

74
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,430
Then, it just gives us
exponential minus t squared

75
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,085
over 2 multiplied by exponential
t squared over 2,

76
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:40,700
which is 1 and c exponential
of minus t squared over 2.

77
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,430
So that's our solution.

78
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,790
But remember that we're trying
to solve an initial value

79
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,340
problem they subject to
an initial condition.

80
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:55,650
And our initial condition is y
of 0 equals to 3, which means

81
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,880
that here, y of 0 would give us
exponential to 0, which is

82
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,060
just a constant.

83
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,830
So we end up with 3 equals
to 1 plus c.

84
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,480
Therefore, c is equal to 2.

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,640
And the final form of the
solution would just be 1 plus

86
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,200
2 exponential of minus
t squared over 2.

87
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,180
So we started with the
indefinite integral.

88
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,070
So what if we would do this
using definite integrals?

89
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:33,010

90
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,760
So we don't need to start
from the beginning.

91
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,580
We just need to take the problem
a few steps before

92
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,260
when we integrated both
sides of the equation.

93
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,410

94
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,210
And here, specify the bounds
of the integral.

95
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,440
So how do we want to specify
the bounds of the integral?

96
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,250
We're given an initial
condition that is

97
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,640
at t equals to 0.

98
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,370
So that's what we want here.

99
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,330
And we're integrating
to the variable t.

100
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,720
But one thing is important when
you do that is that you

101
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,010
have the variable t that is in
the bounds of the integral.

102
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,200
So we want the integrand to not
be written in terms of the

103
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,800
variable of integration.

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,030
So it is very important to
change the label of your

105
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,490
variables in the integrand.

106
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,850

107
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,620
That's how you proceed for
different integrals.

108
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,330
So in this case then, we
end up with similar--

109
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,110

110
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:42,400
so u dot y evaluated at t minus
u dot y evaluated at 0.

111
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,570
And from our initial conditions
in the form of u,

112
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,360
we know the value of this side
of this term in the equation.

113
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,630
And here, we're just again
recognizing that this is just

114
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:59,670
the derivative of exponential to
s squared over 2 evaluated

115
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,490
between 0 and t.

116
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,990
So here, if I just carry on the
right-hand side and then

117
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,100
go back to left-hand side in the
next step, we would end up

118
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,930
here with just t squared
over 2 minus 1.

119
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,060
Exponential of 0 is 1.

120
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,070
And now, let's deal with
this left-hand side.

121
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:26,510
So again, we end up with uy
minus u dot y evaluated at 0.

122
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,810
However, u of 0 is just the
function exponential to t

123
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,400
squared over 2 evaluated
at 0, which is one.

124
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,140
And y of 0, we have it because
that was our initial

125
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,340
condition, and this is only 3.

126
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,510
So we have uy minus 1
dot 3, which is just

127
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,030
basically minus 3.

128
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,500
And on the right-hand side, we
have exponential of t squared

129
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:58,530
over 2 minus 1, which gives us
exponential of t squared

130
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,070
over 2 minus 1.

131
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,010
Now bring in this minus 3 on the
other side, you now have a

132
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:09,350
plus 3, all of this multiplied
by 1 over u, which was our

133
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,240
exponential of minus
t squared over 2.

134
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,280
And therefore, we end up with a
similar solution that we had

135
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,250
for the different integral,
3 minus 1 is just 2.

136
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,070

137
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:30,600
So we have minus t squared
over 2 plus 1.

138
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,010

139
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,890
So using both the definite
integrals approach and the

140
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,559
indefinite integrals, we recover
the same results.

141
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,790
And the main point of this
problem was really to practice

142
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,190
using the integration factor
and practice using both

143
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,110
approaches with the definite
and indefinite integrals.

144
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,410
So this ends the problem.

145
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,660
And I'll see you next time.

146
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,872
