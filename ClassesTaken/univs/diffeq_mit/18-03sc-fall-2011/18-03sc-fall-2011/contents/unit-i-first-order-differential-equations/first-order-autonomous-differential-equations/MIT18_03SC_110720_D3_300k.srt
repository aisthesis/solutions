00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,379

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:07,030
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,780
Welcome back.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,870
So in this problem, I'd like to
take a look at autonomous

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,320
equations and phase lines.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,290
And specifically, we're going
to take a look at the simple

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,170
equation x dot equals ax plus
1, which models birth and

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,120
death rates and a fixed
replenishment rate for a

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,010
population.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,470
So in this case, the variable
a represents births minus

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,050
deaths In a population.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,410
And 1 represents the constant
input of new creatures.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,020
So for part A, we're asked to
find intervals of the variable

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,400
a which determines the long
time stability of the

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,430
population.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,460
And then secondly, for each
typical case of a in the first

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,350
part of the problem, we're asked
to sketch a phase line

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,550
and then also to sketch the
solution x of t versus t.

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,140
So I'll let you take a look at
this problem, and I'll be back

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,390
in a moment.

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:23,337

22
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:24,380
Hi Everyone.

23
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,950
Welcome back.

24
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,280
So the problem we're looking
at is x dot equals ax.

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,920

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,950
And as mentioned in the title
of the problem, this is an

27
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,580
autonomous equation which means
that the right-hand side

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,210
is not a function of time.

29
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,240
The right-hand side
only depends on x.

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,400
And for these types of problems,
the critical points

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,630
or the points at which the
right-hand side vanish tend to

32
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,670
determine the longtime

33
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,420
characteristics of the solution.

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,220
So we can kind of get a handle
on what intervals of a

35
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:12,170
determine the longtime stability
by sketching what x

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,290
dot versus x might look like.

37
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,830
And we see that if a is
positive, this represents a

38
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:29,280
line with a positive slope a.

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,880

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:40,984
So on the right-hand side of the
intercept with the x-axis,

41
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:48,630
x dot is positive, which means
that when the line goes

42
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:56,150
through the point x dot equals
0, the term ax plus 1 is going

43
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,400
to be positive.

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,590

45
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,220
I'll just point out that this
point right here is when x dot

46
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,670
is equal to 0.

47
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,030
And this happens when x is equal
to negative 1 over a.

48
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,970
So this point right here
is negative 1 over a.

49
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,590

50
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,560
And when x is below negative 1
over a, x dot is negative,

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,730
which means that solutions will
want to move away from

52
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,980
the point negative 1 over a.

53
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,760

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,130
What other qualitative behavior
could we have?

55
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:48,020
Well, when a is below 0, when a
is less than 0, the slope of

56
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,100
this curve is going
to be negative.

57
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,250
So I'll plot again
x dot versus x.

58
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,080

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,600
And again, the intercept
is going to be at

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,850
negative 1 over a.

61
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,110

62
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,940
However, when x is above
the critical

63
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,920
point, x dot is negative.

64
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,360
So solutions will want to tend
to move back towards

65
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,270
negative 1 over a.

66
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,309
And when x is below the critical
point, we see that x

67
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:22,840
dot is in the upper plane, which
means it's positive.

68
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,120
So solutions will
want to grow.

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,080

70
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,390
So we have two cases
right now.

71
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,700
One is when a is
bigger than 0.

72
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,220
One is when a is less than 0.

73
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,200
And then, of course, there's
going to be an intermediate

74
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,790
point, which is when
a is equal to 0.

75
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:56,760
And in this case, the curve x
dot versus x, it's just going

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,290
to be a straight line
hat goes through 1.

77
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,410

78
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,360
So this gives us three regions
that will determine the

79
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,840
longtime behavior.

80
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,550
So the three regions are a
equals 0, a less than 0, and

81
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,000
then a bigger than 0.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,430
So this concludes part A. And
for part B, we're asked to

83
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:30,230
investigate the behavior of each
of these three regions by

84
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,220
constructing a phase line, and
then, secondly, by sketching a

85
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,570
solution or several solutions.

86
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,880

87
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:46,550
So for part B, let's take a
look at the case when a is

88
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,480
bigger than 0 first. And
I'm just going to pick

89
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,290
one value of a.

90
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,590
I'll just pick a is equal to 1
to work things out concretely.

91
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,220

92
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,660
And we're asked to sketch
a phase line.

93
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,335
So plot the phase line x here.

94
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:06,000

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,050
And we know from the ODE that
the critical point occurs at

96
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,880
negative 1 over a.

97
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,590
So in this case, there's going
to be one critical point, and

98
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,840
It's going to be
at negative 1.

99
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,690

100
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,010
Now when x is bigger than
negative 1, we've already seen

101
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:27,390
that x dot is going
to be positive.

102
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,415
So when x is bigger than
negative 1, in this region, x

103
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:35,000
dot is positive.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,760
So above negative 1, x dot is
positive, which means that if

105
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,640
a solution starts at a point
above negative 1, it's going

106
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,800
to constantly increase
forever.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,300
And likewise, if it's below
negative 1, it's going to

108
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,940
decrease forever.

109
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,160
So this is x dot is negative
in this region.

110
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:06,940
And of course, x dot is 0 at
the critical point, which

111
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,950
means if we start at the
critical point, we stay there

112
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,200
for all time.

113
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,450
So let's sketch some
solutions.

114
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,190

115
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:23,830
So whenever I have to sketch
solutions for a phase line,

116
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,090
the first solution I always
plot is going to be the

117
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,940
critical point.

118
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,420
So note that x equals negative
1 solves the

119
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,330
differential equation.

120
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,590
So x equals a critical point
always solves the

121
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,500
differential equation.

122
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,180
So that means when x is equal
to negative 1, we solve the

123
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,430
differential equation.

124
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,980

125
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,320
When x is bigger than
negative 1, we

126
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,570
attain exponential growth.

127
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:58,640

128
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,660
And when x is less than
negative 1, we have

129
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,020
exponential growth in the
opposite direction.

130
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,590
So this is sometimes said to be
an unstable critical point,

131
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,760
because any small perturbation
away from negative 1 will make

132
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,230
the solution diverge.

133
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:20,030
Also note that once I have one
of these curves, I can

134
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,640
generate all the others by
just picking it up and

135
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,110
shifting it over.

136
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,630
And the reason this works is
because the original equation

137
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,850
is autonomous, meaning that
the right-hand side didn't

138
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,150
depend on time.

139
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,669
So whenever you have an
autonomous equation, when you

140
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,970
sketch one solution, you can
always get the others by just

141
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,990
picking, or you can always get
a family of others by picking

142
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,835
up that solution and just
shifting it to the right and

143
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:44,085
to the left.

144
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:50,260

145
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:56,910
Now when a is below 0, I'll
just pick the value of a

146
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:04,820
equals negative 1, we have
a critical point at 1.

147
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,960
And in this case, the arrows
are going to point

148
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,970
towards 1 like this.

149
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,590

150
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,480
And again, I can sketch
some curves.

151
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:31,680
So I'll first draw the solution
when x is equal to 1.

152
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:39,510
And in this case, solutions are
going to converge towards

153
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,760
the critical point.

154
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,410

155
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,490
And in this case, we say
that the critical point

156
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,515
x equals 1 is stable.

157
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:54,450

158
00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:05,390
And that's because any small
perturbation in the solution

159
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,640
will eventually just come
back to the critical

160
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,890
point at x equals 1.

161
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,570

162
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,200
And now lastly, we have the
third case which is

163
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,450
when a equals 0.

164
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,560

165
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,050
And in this case, there are
no critical points.

166
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,330
In fact, x dot was equal to 1.

167
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:30,900
So x dot is positive for
all values of x.

168
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,930
So our phase line is just
a line with arrows.

169
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,520
And in this case, if I were to
sketch some solutions, I'll

170
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,990
just draw my axes, x and t,
there are no critical points.

171
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,160
X is just increasing.

172
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,700
So the solutions are going to
look something like this.

173
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,750

174
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,460
They're just going to be a
family of straight lines.

175
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,500

176
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,030
So we've just sketched some
phase lines, and we sketched

177
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,940
several solutions for
each phase line.

178
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,740
We've seen how the critical
points and the arrows around

179
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,950
the critical points affect
the long time

180
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,130
behavior of the solutions.

181
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,150
And this is typically the
process that you go through

182
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,900
when looking at autonomous
equations.

183
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,640
You always first, A, find the
critical points, then B, find

184
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,630
the regions between the critical
points and figure out

185
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,160
if x dot is either positive
or negative.

186
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,990
And then that automatically
gives you the phase line.

187
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,370
Once you have the phase line,
you can always just sketch a

188
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,140
family of solutions.

189
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,600
So I'd like to conclude here.

190
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,850
And I'll see you next time.

191
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,860
