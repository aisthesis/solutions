00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,310

2
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,230
PROFESSOR: The phase lines
mathlet helps us to understand

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,765
the behavior of nonlinear
autonomous equations.

4
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:10,070
The large graphing window
shows a direction field.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:16,650
The horizontal axis is t, and
the vertical axis is y.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,550
As you see, the direction field
is independent of t.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,150
This is the significance of
an autonomous equation.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,080
The applet opens with the
equation 1 minus y times y

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,130
minus a, but I want to talk
to you about a different

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,090
equation, namely this one, which
can be written as the

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:44,210
quantity a minus y, times
y, minus 1/4.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,380
This is a logistic equation
with harvesting.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,950
Specifically, this is a model
of the oryx population in a

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,950
certain game preserve in
Kenya, measured in

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,710
kilooryx and years.

16
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,580
The Kenyan government wants to
sell permits to kill 1/4

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,420
kilooryx per year, and it wants
to know how large a game

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,780
preserve it should create to
guarantee a stable oryx

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,090
population.

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,930
The size of the preserve
determines what would be the

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,120
limiting population of oryx
which is the number a.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,230
We can use this applet to
explore the options to

23
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,500
recommend to the Kenyan
government.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,050
We can control the parameter a
using this slider down here.

25
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,560
Right now, it's set to a equals
0, so the equation is y

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,210
prime equals minus 1/4 minus y
squared, always negative, so

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,260
all the solutions decrease.

28
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,170
With a game preserve of zero
area, the population is

29
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,100
guaranteed to collapse.

30
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,170
We can draw some solution
curves by

31
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,200
clicking on this window.

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,330
You'll notice that any
horizontal translate of the

33
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,600
solution is another solution to
this differential equation.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,380
Is another consequence of the
fact that it's an autonomous

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,770
differential equation.

36
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,120
We can increase the value
of a using this slider.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,940
And when I do, notice
that the change in

38
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,630
the direction field--

39
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,040
it starts to flatten out,
especially in an area just

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,650
above the t-axis.

41
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:34,510
And when a takes on the value
1, a solution appears, a

42
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,930
constant solution in blue.

43
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,460
This is an equilibrium
solution.

44
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,700
We can measure the value
of y along it.

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,010
There's a readout below
the screen.

46
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,930
It seems that y is about 1/2.

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,640
And if we take a equals 1 and
y equals 1/2, and plug those

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,050
values into this equation, you
will get y prime equals 0.

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,190
In other words, you get
a constant solution.

50
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,260
Now notice this parabola in the
lower left of the screen.

51
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,740
As I change a, it moves.

52
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:18,360
That parabola is the graph of
y prime as a function of y.

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,660
So it depends upon a.

54
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,290
When a moves up to the value a
equals 1, the parabola moves

55
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,940
up and touches the y-axis at
the value y equals 1/2.

56
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,450

57
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,560
Now this blue curve represents
a steady state solution, but

58
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,700
the Kenyan government would be
ill-advised to use a preserve

59
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
only this big.

60
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,850
Because random fluctuations will
occasionally drive the

61
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,310
population of oryx below y
equals 1/2, and as soon as

62
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,270
that happens, disaster ensues.

63
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,410
The population is guaranteed
to collapse.

64
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,680
So let's take a bigger game
preserve, make a larger, and

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:10,170
when you do that, the parabola
moves up, the blue double root

66
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,250
splits into two roots, and
the equilibrium solution

67
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,605
bifurcates into two equilibrium
solutions.

68
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:21,480

69
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,670
The red equilibrium
is unstable.

70
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,890
Solutions near to it
diverge from it.

71
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,370
In fact, solutions below
it approach infinity.

72
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,610
These curves become asymptotic
to vertical straight lines.

73
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,260
They blow up in finite time.

74
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,090
Solutions between the two
equilibria move from the lower

75
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,660
equilibrium up to the green,
upper equilibrium, and

76
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:55,085
solutions above the green
equilibrium decay towards it.

77
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:59,330
The green solution is a
stable equilibrium.

78
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,110
You can see this behavior
by looking at

79
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,050
the parabola as well.

80
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:11,040
If the value of y is less than
the red zero, the value of the

81
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,260
parabola is negative.

82
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,180
Solutions are falling.

83
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,070
Between the two roots, the value
of y prime is positive.

84
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,150
Solutions are growing.

85
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,950
And to the right of this
equilibrium, the value of y

86
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,350
prime is negative.

87
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,450
Solutions are falling again.

88
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,200

89
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,570
You can see all this very neatly
using the phase line,

90
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,400
which I can invoke using
this key here.

91
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,410
The phase line carries all the
information present in the

92
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,340
direction field, but in a
much more compact form.

93
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,710
You can see the two equilibria
marked, and below this

94
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,130
equilibrium, all the solutions
are decaying.

95
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,720
Between the two, the solutions
are all increasing, and above

96
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,170
the upper equilibrium, the
solutions are all decaying.

97
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,010
These are indicated by
these yellow arrows.

98
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,370

99
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,476
Now the Kenyan government
has some leeway.

100
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:15,690
It may predict an accidental
variation

101
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,480
of, say, 1/2 kilooryx.

102
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,130
In that case, it should arrange
a game preserve large

103
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,830
enough so that the distance
between the two critical

104
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,570
points is at least 1/2.

105
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,760
Then, assuming that the initial
population is close to

106
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,530
this equilibrium, a deviation
of 1/2 won't be a disaster,

107
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,710
because the population will
recover and return to the

108
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,990
stable equilibrium.

109
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,590
Well, we've come a long way.

110
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,880
We're now looking at a family
of differential equations,

111
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,790
when indexed by the
parameter a.

112
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,665
Each value of a has its own
direction field, its own set

113
00:06:57,665 --> 00:07:04,090
of critical points, it's
own solutions, and

114
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,290
its own phase line.

115
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,790
But as we see, for practical
policy reasons, it's important

116
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,230
to be able to consider them
all simultaneously.

117
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,180
The bifurcation diagram lets
you do exactly that.

118
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,730
Let's invoke it with
this check box.

119
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,540
The diagram has appeared
above the a slider.

120
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,530
In it is marked a curve.

121
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,310
This curve consists of all the
critical points for these

122
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,480
differential equations for
all values of a, marked

123
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,230
simultaneously.

124
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,120
The critical points for a given
value of a appear above

125
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,760
that value of a in the slider.

126
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,540
So here's the phase line for
this value of a containing an

127
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,210
unstable critical point and
a stable critical point.

128
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,360
And when I change the value
of a, that phase

129
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,110
line changes and moves.

130
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,860
And as the value of a decreases
to a equals 1, those

131
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,270
two critical points collide and
form a single semi-stable

132
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,860
critical point.

133
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,040
For smaller values of a, there
are no critical points, until

134
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,800
you reach the value a equals
minus 1, when a single

135
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,140
semi-stable critical point
appears and then bifurcates

136
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:27,270
into two critical points for
smaller values of a.

137
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,460
The critical curve is color
coded according to the type of

138
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,870
critical point that
it represents.

139
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,059
The bifurcation diagram takes
place in the a/y plane.

140
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,560
It's the curve defined by the
equation y prime equals 0.

141
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,820
In this case, that's minus 1/4
plus ay minus y squared.

142
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,945
