1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06

2
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
Today, once again,
a day of solving no

3
00:00:03 --> 00:00:09
differential equations
whatsoever.

4
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11
The topic is a special kind of
differential equation,

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
which occurs a lot.
It's one in which the

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:19
right-hand side doesn't have any
independent variable in it.

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:24
Now, since I'm going to use as
the independent variable,

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
t for time, maybe it would be
better to write the left-hand

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:34
side to let you know,
since you won't be able to

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:38
figure out any other way what it
is, dy dt.

11
00:00:37 --> 00:00:43
We will write it this time.
dy dt is equal to,

12
00:00:42 --> 00:00:48
and the point is that there is
no t on the right hand side.

13
00:00:50 --> 00:00:56
So, there's no t.
There's a name for such an

14
00:00:56 --> 00:01:02
equation.
Now, some people call it time

15
00:01:01 --> 00:01:07
independent.
The only problem with that is

16
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
that sometimes the independent
variable is a time.

17
00:01:12 --> 00:01:18
It's something else.
We need a generic word for

18
00:01:17 --> 00:01:23
there being no independent
variable on the right-hand side.

19
00:01:24 --> 00:01:30
So, the word that's used for
that is autonomous.

20
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
So, that means no independent
variable on the right-hand side.

21
00:01:37 --> 00:01:43
It's a function of y alone,
the dependent variable.

22
00:01:41 --> 00:01:47
Now, your first reaction should
be, oh, well,

23
00:01:45 --> 00:01:51
big deal.
Big deal.

24
00:01:47 --> 00:01:53
If there's no t on the right
hand side, then we can solve

25
00:01:53 --> 00:01:59
this by separating variables.
So, why has he been talking

26
00:01:58 --> 00:02:04
about it in the first place?
So, I admit that.

27
00:02:03 --> 00:02:09
We can separate variables,
and what I'm going to talk

28
00:02:07 --> 00:02:13
about today is how to get useful
information out of the equation

29
00:02:12 --> 00:02:18
about how its solutions look
without solving the equation.

30
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
The reason for wanting to do
that is, A, it's fast.

31
00:02:21 --> 00:02:27
It gives you a lot of insight,
and the actual solution,

32
00:02:25 --> 00:02:31
I'll illustrate one,
in the first place,

33
00:02:29 --> 00:02:35
take you quite a while.
You may not be able to actually

34
00:02:35 --> 00:02:41
do the integrations,
the required and separation of

35
00:02:40 --> 00:02:46
variables to get an explicit
solution, or it might simply not

36
00:02:47 --> 00:02:53
be worth the effort of doing if
you only want certain kinds of

37
00:02:53 --> 00:02:59
separations about the solution.
So, the thing is,

38
00:02:58 --> 00:03:04
the problem is,
therefore, to get qualitative

39
00:03:03 --> 00:03:09
information about the solutions
without actually solving --

40
00:03:11 --> 00:03:17
Without actually having to
solve the equation.

41
00:03:14 --> 00:03:20
Now, to do that,
let's take a quick look at how

42
00:03:18 --> 00:03:24
the direction fields of such an
equation, after all,

43
00:03:22 --> 00:03:28
it's the direction field is our
principal tool for getting

44
00:03:27 --> 00:03:33
qualitative information about
solutions without actually

45
00:03:32 --> 00:03:38
solving.
So, how does the direction

46
00:03:35 --> 00:03:41
field look?
Well, think about it for just a

47
00:03:39 --> 00:03:45
second, and you will see that
every horizontal line is an

48
00:03:44 --> 00:03:50
isocline.
So, the horizontal lines,

49
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
what are their equations?
This is the t axis.

50
00:03:51 --> 00:03:57
And, here's the y axis.
The horizontal lines have the

51
00:03:56 --> 00:04:02
formula y equals a constant.
Let's make it y equals a y zero

52
00:04:01 --> 00:04:07
for different values of the
constant y zero.

53
00:04:06 --> 00:04:12
Those are the horizontal lines.
And, the point is they are

54
00:04:11 --> 00:04:17
isoclines.
Why?

55
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
Well, because along any one of
these horizontal lines,

56
00:04:17 --> 00:04:23
I'll draw one in,
what are the slopes of the line

57
00:04:22 --> 00:04:28
elements?
The slopes are dy / dt is equal

58
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
to f of y zero,
but that's a constant because

59
00:04:30 --> 00:04:36
there's no t to change as you
move in the horizontal

60
00:04:35 --> 00:04:41
direction.
The slope is a constant.

61
00:04:39 --> 00:04:45
So, if I draw in that isocline,
I guess I've forgotten,

62
00:04:44 --> 00:04:50
as our convention,
isoclines are in dashed lines,

63
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
but if you have color,
you are allowed to put them in

64
00:04:51 --> 00:04:57
living yellow.
Well, I guess I could make them

65
00:04:55 --> 00:05:01
solid, in that case.
I don't have to make a dash.

66
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
Then, all the line elements,
you put them in at will because

67
00:05:04 --> 00:05:10
they will all have,
they are all the same,

68
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
and they have slope,
that, f of y0.

69
00:05:11 --> 00:05:17
And, similarly down here,
they'll have some other slope.

70
00:05:16 --> 00:05:22
This one will have some other
slope.

71
00:05:18 --> 00:05:24
Whatever, this is the y zero,
the value of it,

72
00:05:23 --> 00:05:29
and whatever that happens to
be.

73
00:05:25 --> 00:05:31
I'll put it one more.
That's the x-axis.

74
00:05:30 --> 00:05:36
I can use the x-axis.
That's an isocline,

75
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
too.
Now, what do you deduce about

76
00:05:36 --> 00:05:42
how the solutions must look?
Well, let's draw one solution.

77
00:05:41 --> 00:05:47
Suppose one solution looks like
this.

78
00:05:44 --> 00:05:50
Well, that's an integral curve,
in other words.

79
00:05:48 --> 00:05:54
Its graph is a solution.
Now, as I slide along,

80
00:05:52 --> 00:05:58
these slope elements stay
exactly the same,

81
00:05:56 --> 00:06:02
I can slide this curb along
horizontally,

82
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
and it will still be an
integral curve everywhere.

83
00:06:06 --> 00:06:12
So, in other words,
they integral curves are

84
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
invariant under translation for
an equation of this type.

85
00:06:14 --> 00:06:20
They all look exactly the same,
and you get them all by taking

86
00:06:20 --> 00:06:26
one, and just pushing it along.
Well, that's so simple it's

87
00:06:25 --> 00:06:31
almost uninteresting,
except in that these equations

88
00:06:30 --> 00:06:36
occur a lot in practice.
They are often hard to

89
00:06:34 --> 00:06:40
integrate directly.
And, therefore,

90
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
it's important to be able to
get information about them.

91
00:06:42 --> 00:06:48
Now, how does one do that?
There's one critical idea,

92
00:06:45 --> 00:06:51
and that is the notion of a
critical point.

93
00:06:48 --> 00:06:54
These equations have what are
called critical points.

94
00:06:52 --> 00:06:58
And, what it is is very simple.
There are three ways of looking

95
00:06:57 --> 00:07:03
at it: critical point,
y zero;

96
00:06:59 --> 00:07:05
what does it mean for y0 to be
a critical point?

97
00:07:04 --> 00:07:10
It means, another way of saying
it is that it should be a zero

98
00:07:08 --> 00:07:14
of the right-hand side.
So, if I ask you to find the

99
00:07:11 --> 00:07:17
critical points for the
equation, what you will do is

100
00:07:15 --> 00:07:21
solve the equation f of y equals
zero.

101
00:07:18 --> 00:07:24
Now, what's interesting about
them?

102
00:07:21 --> 00:07:27
Well, for a critical point,
what would be the slope of the

103
00:07:25 --> 00:07:31
line element along,
if this is at a critical level,

104
00:07:28 --> 00:07:34
if that's a critical point?
Look at that isocline.

105
00:07:33 --> 00:07:39
What's the slope of the line
elements along it?

106
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
It is zero.
And therefore,

107
00:07:39 --> 00:07:45
for these guys,
these are, in other words,

108
00:07:43 --> 00:07:49
our solution curves.
But let's prove it formally.

109
00:07:48 --> 00:07:54
So, there are three ways of
saying it.

110
00:07:52 --> 00:07:58
y zero is a critical point.

111
00:07:55 --> 00:08:01
It's a zero of the right-hand
side, or, y equals y0 is a

112
00:08:00 --> 00:08:06
solution to the equation.
Now, that's perfectly easy to

113
00:08:05 --> 00:08:11
verify.
If y zero makes this

114
00:08:10 --> 00:08:16
right-hand side zero,
it's certainly also y equals y0

115
00:08:14 --> 00:08:20
makes the left-hand
side zero because you're

116
00:08:18 --> 00:08:24
differentiating a constant.
So, the reasoning,

117
00:08:21 --> 00:08:27
if you want reasoning,
is proof.

118
00:08:24 --> 00:08:30
Maybe we can make one line out
of a proof.

119
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
To say that it's a solution,
what does it mean to say that

120
00:08:33 --> 00:08:39
it's a solution?
It means to say that when you

121
00:08:38 --> 00:08:44
plug it in, plug in this
constant function,

122
00:08:42 --> 00:08:48
y0, the dy0 dt is equal to f of
y0.

123
00:08:47 --> 00:08:53
Is that true?
Yeah.

124
00:08:49 --> 00:08:55
Both sides are zero.
It's true.

125
00:08:52 --> 00:08:58
Now, y0 is not a number.
Well, it is.

126
00:08:56 --> 00:09:02
It's a number on this side,
but on this side,

127
00:09:00 --> 00:09:06
what I mean is a constant
function whose constant value is

128
00:09:06 --> 00:09:12
y zero, this function,

129
00:09:09 --> 00:09:15
and its derivatives are zero
because it has slope zero

130
00:09:14 --> 00:09:20
everywhere.
So, this guy is a constant

131
00:09:20 --> 00:09:26
function, has slope zero.
This is a number which makes

132
00:09:25 --> 00:09:31
the right-hand side zero.
Well, that's nice.

133
00:09:30 --> 00:09:36
So, in other words,
what we found are,

134
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
by finding these critical
points, solving that equation,

135
00:09:38 --> 00:09:44
we found all the horizontal
solutions.

136
00:09:41 --> 00:09:47
But, what's so good about
those?

137
00:09:44 --> 00:09:50
Surely, they must be the most
interesting solutions there are.

138
00:09:50 --> 00:09:56
Well, think of how the picture
goes.

139
00:09:53 --> 00:09:59
Let's draw in one of those
horizontal solutions.

140
00:09:57 --> 00:10:03
So, here's a horizontal
solution.

141
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
That's a solution.
So, this is my y0.

142
00:10:05 --> 00:10:11
That's the height at which it
is.

143
00:10:08 --> 00:10:14
And, I'm assuming that f of y0
equals zero.

144
00:10:13 --> 00:10:19
So, that's a solution.
Now, the significance of that

145
00:10:18 --> 00:10:24
is, because it's a solution,
in other words,

146
00:10:22 --> 00:10:28
it's an integral curve,
remember what's true about

147
00:10:27 --> 00:10:33
integral curves.
Other curves are not allowed to

148
00:10:31 --> 00:10:37
cross them.
And therefore,

149
00:10:35 --> 00:10:41
these things are the absolute
barriers.

150
00:10:38 --> 00:10:44
So, for example,
suppose I have two of them is

151
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
y0, and let's say here's another
one, another constant solution.

152
00:10:47 --> 00:10:53
I want to know what the curves
in between those can do.

153
00:10:52 --> 00:10:58
Well, I do know that whatever
those red curves do,

154
00:10:56 --> 00:11:02
the other integral curves,
they cannot cross this,

155
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
and they cannot cross that.
And, you must be able to

156
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
translate them along each other
without ever having two of them

157
00:11:12 --> 00:11:18
intersect.
Now, that really limits their

158
00:11:16 --> 00:11:22
behavior, but I'm going to nail
it down even more.

159
00:11:21 --> 00:11:27
So, other curves can't cross
these.

160
00:11:24 --> 00:11:30
Other integral curves can't
cross these yellow curves,

161
00:11:29 --> 00:11:35
these yellow lines,
these horizontal lines.

162
00:11:35 --> 00:11:41
But, I'm going to show you
more, and namely,

163
00:11:39 --> 00:11:45
so what I'm after is deciding,
without solving the equation,

164
00:11:45 --> 00:11:51
what those curves must look
like in between.

165
00:11:49 --> 00:11:55
Now, the way to do that is you
draw, so if we want to make

166
00:11:55 --> 00:12:01
steps, everybody likes steps,
okay, so step one is going to

167
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
be, find these.
Find the critical points.

168
00:12:06 --> 00:12:12
And, you're going to do that by
solving this equation,

169
00:12:11 --> 00:12:17
finding out where it's zero.
Once you have done that,

170
00:12:16 --> 00:12:22
you are going to draw the graph
of f of y.

171
00:12:21 --> 00:12:27
And, the interest is going to
be, where is it positive?

172
00:12:27 --> 00:12:33
Where is it negative?
You've already found where it's

173
00:12:32 --> 00:12:38
zero.
Everywhere else,

174
00:12:35 --> 00:12:41
therefore, it must be either
positive or negative.

175
00:12:39 --> 00:12:45
Now, once you have found that
out, why am I interested in

176
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
that?
Well, because dy / dt is equal

177
00:12:46 --> 00:12:52
to f of y, right?

178
00:12:49 --> 00:12:55
That's what the differential
equation says.

179
00:12:52 --> 00:12:58
Therefore, if this,
for example,

180
00:12:55 --> 00:13:01
is positive,
that means this must be

181
00:12:57 --> 00:13:03
positive.
It means that y must be

182
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
increasing.
It means the solution must be

183
00:13:03 --> 00:13:09
increasing.
Where it's negative,

184
00:13:07 --> 00:13:13
the solution will be
decreasing.

185
00:13:09 --> 00:13:15
And, that tells me how it's
behaving in between these yellow

186
00:13:13 --> 00:13:19
lines, or on top of them,
or on the bottom.

187
00:13:15 --> 00:13:21
Now, at this point,
I'm going to stop,

188
00:13:18 --> 00:13:24
or not stop,
I mean, I'm going to stop

189
00:13:20 --> 00:13:26
talking generally.
And everything in the rest of

190
00:13:23 --> 00:13:29
the period will be done by
examples which will get

191
00:13:26 --> 00:13:32
increasingly complicated,
not terribly complicated by the

192
00:13:30 --> 00:13:36
end.
But, let's do one that's super

193
00:13:34 --> 00:13:40
simple to begin with.
Sorry, I shouldn't say that

194
00:13:38 --> 00:13:44
because some of you may be
baffled even by here because

195
00:13:42 --> 00:13:48
after all I'm going to be doing
the analysis not in the usual

196
00:13:47 --> 00:13:53
way, but by using new ideas.
That's the way you make

197
00:13:52 --> 00:13:58
progress.
All right, so,

198
00:13:53 --> 00:13:59
let's do our bank account.
So, y is money in the bank

199
00:13:58 --> 00:14:04
account.
r is the interest rate.

200
00:14:02 --> 00:14:08
Let's assume it's a continuous
interest rate.

201
00:14:06 --> 00:14:12
All banks nowadays pay interest
continuously,

202
00:14:11 --> 00:14:17
the continuous interest rate.
So, if that's all there is,

203
00:14:16 --> 00:14:22
and money is growing,
you know the differential

204
00:14:21 --> 00:14:27
equation says that the rate at
which it grows is equal to r,

205
00:14:26 --> 00:14:32
the interest rate times a
principle, the amount that's in

206
00:14:32 --> 00:14:38
the bank at that time.
So, that's the differential

207
00:14:38 --> 00:14:44
equation that governs that.
Now, that's,

208
00:14:41 --> 00:14:47
of course, the solution is
simply an exponential curve.

209
00:14:46 --> 00:14:52
There's nothing more to say
about it.

210
00:14:49 --> 00:14:55
Now, let's make it more
interesting.

211
00:14:52 --> 00:14:58
Let's suppose there is a shifty
teller at the bank,

212
00:14:56 --> 00:15:02
and your money is being
embezzled from your account at a

213
00:15:01 --> 00:15:07
constant rate.
So, let's let w equal,

214
00:15:06 --> 00:15:12
or maybe e, but e has so many
other uses in mathematics,

215
00:15:11 --> 00:15:17
w is relatively unused,
w is the rate of embezzlement,

216
00:15:16 --> 00:15:22
thought of as continuous.
So, every day a little bit of

217
00:15:21 --> 00:15:27
money is sneaked out of your
account because you are not

218
00:15:26 --> 00:15:32
paying any attention to it.
You're off skiing somewhere,

219
00:15:31 --> 00:15:37
and not noticing what's
happening to your bank account.

220
00:15:38 --> 00:15:44
So, since it's the rate,
the time rate of embezzlement,

221
00:15:42 --> 00:15:48
I simply subtract it from this.
It's not w times y because the

222
00:15:47 --> 00:15:53
embezzler isn't stealing a
certain fraction of your

223
00:15:51 --> 00:15:57
account.
It's simply stealing a certain

224
00:15:54 --> 00:16:00
number of dollars every day,
the same number of dollars

225
00:15:59 --> 00:16:05
being withdrawn for the count.
Okay, now, of course,

226
00:16:03 --> 00:16:09
you could solve this.
This separates variables

227
00:16:07 --> 00:16:13
immediately.
You get the answer,

228
00:16:10 --> 00:16:16
and there's no problem with
that.

229
00:16:12 --> 00:16:18
Let's analyze the behavior of
the solutions without solving

230
00:16:17 --> 00:16:23
the equation by using these two
points.

231
00:16:20 --> 00:16:26
So, I want to analyze this
equation using the method of

232
00:16:24 --> 00:16:30
critical points.
So, the first thing I should do

233
00:16:28 --> 00:16:34
is, so, here's our equation,
is find the critical points.

234
00:16:34 --> 00:16:40
Notice it's an autonomous
equation all right,

235
00:16:38 --> 00:16:44
because there's no t on the
right-hand side.

236
00:16:42 --> 00:16:48
Okay, so, the critical points,
well, that's where ry minus w

237
00:16:48 --> 00:16:54
equals zero.
In other words,

238
00:16:51 --> 00:16:57
there's only one critical
point, and that occurs when y is

239
00:16:56 --> 00:17:02
equal to w over r.
So, that's the only critical

240
00:17:01 --> 00:17:07
point.
Now, I want to know what's

241
00:17:05 --> 00:17:11
happening to the solution.
So, in other words,

242
00:17:09 --> 00:17:15
if I plot, I can write away,
of course, negative values

243
00:17:14 --> 00:17:20
aren't of particularly
interesting here,

244
00:17:17 --> 00:17:23
there is definitely a
horizontal solution,

245
00:17:21 --> 00:17:27
and it has the value,
it's at the height,

246
00:17:25 --> 00:17:31
w over r.
That's a solution.

247
00:17:30 --> 00:17:36
The question is,
what do the other solutions

248
00:17:33 --> 00:17:39
look like?
Now, watch how I make the

249
00:17:35 --> 00:17:41
analysis because I'm going to
use two now.

250
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
So, this is step one,
then step two.

251
00:17:41 --> 00:17:47
What do I do? Well, 
I'm going to graph f of y.

252
00:17:45 --> 00:17:51
Well, f of y is ry minus w.

253
00:17:47 --> 00:17:53
What does that look like?

254
00:17:50 --> 00:17:56
Okay, so, here is the y-axis.
Notice the y-axis is going

255
00:17:55 --> 00:18:01
horizontally because what I'm
interested in is the graph of

256
00:17:59 --> 00:18:05
this function.
What do I call the other axis?

257
00:18:04 --> 00:18:10
I'm going to use the same
terminology that is used on the

258
00:18:08 --> 00:18:14
little visual that describes
this.

259
00:18:11 --> 00:18:17
And, that's dy.
You could call this other axis

260
00:18:14 --> 00:18:20
the f of y axis.
That's not a good name for it.

261
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
You could call it the dy / dt
axis because it's,

262
00:18:22 --> 00:18:28
so to speak,
the other variable.

263
00:18:24 --> 00:18:30
That's not great either.
But, worst of all would be

264
00:18:28 --> 00:18:34
introducing yet another letter
for which we would have no use

265
00:18:32 --> 00:18:38
whatsoever.
So, let's think of it.

266
00:18:37 --> 00:18:43
We are plotting,
now, the graph of f of y.

267
00:18:40 --> 00:18:46
f of y is this function,

268
00:18:43 --> 00:18:49
ry minus w.
Well, that's a line.

269
00:18:48 --> 00:18:54
Its intercept is down here at
w, and so the graph looks

270
00:18:53 --> 00:18:59
something like this.
It's a line.

271
00:18:55 --> 00:19:01
This is the line,
ry minus w.

272
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
It has slope r.
Well, what am I going to get

273
00:19:05 --> 00:19:11
out of that line?
Just exactly this.

274
00:19:08 --> 00:19:14
What am I interested in about
that line?

275
00:19:13 --> 00:19:19
Nothing other than where is it
above the axis,

276
00:19:18 --> 00:19:24
and where is it below?
This function is positive over

277
00:19:23 --> 00:19:29
here, and therefore,
I'm going to indicate that

278
00:19:28 --> 00:19:34
symbolically,
this, by putting an arrow here.

279
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
The meeting of this arrow is
that y of t is

280
00:19:39 --> 00:19:45
increasing.
See where it's the right-hand

281
00:19:43 --> 00:19:49
side of that last board?
y of t is increasing when f of

282
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
y is positive.
f of y is positive here,

283
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
and therefore,
to the right of this point,

284
00:19:55 --> 00:20:01
it's increasing.
Here to the left of it,

285
00:19:59 --> 00:20:05
f of y is negative,
and therefore over here it's

286
00:20:03 --> 00:20:09
going to be decreasing.
What point is this,

287
00:20:08 --> 00:20:14
in fact?
Well, that's where it crosses

288
00:20:11 --> 00:20:17
the axis.
That's exactly the critical

289
00:20:15 --> 00:20:21
point, w over r.
Therefore, what this says is

290
00:20:19 --> 00:20:25
that a solution,
once it's bigger than y over r,

291
00:20:24 --> 00:20:30
it increases,
and it increases faster and

292
00:20:28 --> 00:20:34
faster because this function is
higher and higher.

293
00:20:34 --> 00:20:40
And, that represents the rate
of change.

294
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
So, in other words,
once the solution,

295
00:20:40 --> 00:20:46
let's say a solution starts
over here at time zero.

296
00:20:44 --> 00:20:50
So, this is the t axis.
And, here is the y axis.

297
00:20:48 --> 00:20:54
So, now, I'm plotting
solutions.

298
00:20:51 --> 00:20:57
If it starts at t equals zero,
above this line,

299
00:20:55 --> 00:21:01
that is, starts with the value
w over r,

300
00:20:59 --> 00:21:05
which is bigger than zero,
a value bigger than w over r,

301
00:21:04 --> 00:21:10
then it increases,
and increases faster and

302
00:21:07 --> 00:21:13
faster.
If it starts below that,

303
00:21:12 --> 00:21:18
it decreases and decreases
faster and faster.

304
00:21:16 --> 00:21:22
Now, in fact,
I only have to draw two of

305
00:21:20 --> 00:21:26
those because what do all the
others look like?

306
00:21:24 --> 00:21:30
They are translations.
All the other curves look

307
00:21:29 --> 00:21:35
exactly like those.
They are just translations of

308
00:21:35 --> 00:21:41
them.
This guy, if I start closer,

309
00:21:39 --> 00:21:45
it's still going to decrease.
Well, that's supposed to be a

310
00:21:47 --> 00:21:53
translation.
Maybe it is.

311
00:21:50 --> 00:21:56
So, these guys look like that.
Let's do just a tiny bit more

312
00:21:57 --> 00:22:03
interpretation of that.
Well, I think I better leave it

313
00:22:06 --> 00:22:12
there because we've got harder
things to do,

314
00:22:13 --> 00:22:19
and I want to make sure we've
got time for it.

315
00:22:19 --> 00:22:25
Sorry.
Okay, next example,

316
00:22:23 --> 00:22:29
a logistic equation.
Some of you have already solved

317
00:22:31 --> 00:22:37
this in recitation,
and some of you haven't.

318
00:22:39 --> 00:22:45
This is a population equation.
This is the one that section

319
00:22:44 --> 00:22:50
7.1 and section 1.7 is most
heavily concerned with,

320
00:22:48 --> 00:22:54
this particular equation.
The derivation of it is a

321
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
little vague.
It's an equation which

322
00:22:55 --> 00:23:01
describes how population
increases.

323
00:22:58 --> 00:23:04
And one minute,
the population behavior of some

324
00:23:02 --> 00:23:08
population, --
-- let's call it,

325
00:23:06 --> 00:23:12
y is the only thing I know to
call anything today,

326
00:23:10 --> 00:23:16
but of course your book uses
capital P for population,

327
00:23:15 --> 00:23:21
to get you used to different
variables.

328
00:23:18 --> 00:23:24
Now, the basic population
equation runs dy / dt.

329
00:23:22 --> 00:23:28
There's a certain growth rate.
Let's call it k y.

330
00:23:26 --> 00:23:32
So, k is what's called the
growth rate.

331
00:23:29 --> 00:23:35
It's actually,
sometimes it's talked about in

332
00:23:33 --> 00:23:39
terms of birthrate.
But, it's the net birth rate.

333
00:23:38 --> 00:23:44
It's the rate at which people,
or bacteria,

334
00:23:42 --> 00:23:48
or whatever are being born
minus the rate at which they are

335
00:23:47 --> 00:23:53
dying.
So, it's a net birthrate.

336
00:23:49 --> 00:23:55
But, let's just call it the
growth rate.

337
00:23:53 --> 00:23:59
Now, if this is the equation,
we can think of this,

338
00:23:57 --> 00:24:03
if k is constant,
that's what's called simple

339
00:24:01 --> 00:24:07
population growth.
And you are all familiar with

340
00:24:05 --> 00:24:11
that.
Logistical growth allows for

341
00:24:08 --> 00:24:14
slightly more complex
situations.

342
00:24:13 --> 00:24:19
Logistic growth says that
calling k a constant is

343
00:24:18 --> 00:24:24
unrealistic because the Earth is
not filled entirely with people.

344
00:24:26 --> 00:24:32
What stops it from having
unlimited growth?

345
00:24:32 --> 00:24:38
Well, the fact that the
resources, the food,

346
00:24:36 --> 00:24:42
the organism has to live on
gets depleted.

347
00:24:41 --> 00:24:47
And, in other words,
the growth rate declines as y

348
00:24:46 --> 00:24:52
increases.
As the population increases,

349
00:24:50 --> 00:24:56
one expects the growth rate to
decline because resources are

350
00:24:56 --> 00:25:02
being used up,
and they are not indefinitely

351
00:25:01 --> 00:25:07
available.
Well, in other words,

352
00:25:05 --> 00:25:11
we should replace k by a
function with this behavior.

353
00:25:09 --> 00:25:15
What's the simplest function
that declines as y increases?

354
00:25:14 --> 00:25:20
The simplest choice,
and if you are ignorant about

355
00:25:17 --> 00:25:23
what else to do,
stick with the simplest,

356
00:25:20 --> 00:25:26
at least you won't work any
harder than you have to,

357
00:25:24 --> 00:25:30
would be to take k equal to the
simplest declining function of y

358
00:25:29 --> 00:25:35
there is, which is simply a
linear function,

359
00:25:32 --> 00:25:38
A minus BY.
So, if I use that as the choice

360
00:25:37 --> 00:25:43
of the declining growth rate,
the new equation is dy / dt

361
00:25:41 --> 00:25:47
equals, here's my new k.
The y stays the same,

362
00:25:45 --> 00:25:51
so the equation becomes a minus
by, the quantity times y,

363
00:25:50 --> 00:25:56
or in other words,

364
00:25:53 --> 00:25:59
ay minus b y squared.

365
00:25:55 --> 00:26:01
This equation is what's called
the logistic equation.

366
00:26:01 --> 00:26:07
It has many applications,
not just to population growth.

367
00:26:05 --> 00:26:11
It's applied to the spread of
disease, the spread of a rumor,

368
00:26:11 --> 00:26:17
the spread of many things.
Yeah, a couple pieces of chalk

369
00:26:16 --> 00:26:22
here.

370
00:26:17 --> 00:26:23

371

372

373
00:26:28 --> 00:26:34
Okay, now, those of you who
have solved it know that the

374
00:26:34 --> 00:26:40
explicit solution involves,
well, you separate variables,

375
00:26:40 --> 00:26:46
but you will have to use
partial fractions,

376
00:26:44 --> 00:26:50
ugh, I hope you love partial
fractions.

377
00:26:48 --> 00:26:54
You're going to need them later
in the term.

378
00:26:53 --> 00:26:59
But, I could avoid them now by
not solving the equation

379
00:26:59 --> 00:27:05
explicitly.
But anyway, you get a solution,

380
00:27:03 --> 00:27:09
which I was going to write on
the board for you,

381
00:27:06 --> 00:27:12
but you could look it up in
your book.

382
00:27:09 --> 00:27:15
It's unpleasant enough looking
to make you feel that there must

383
00:27:13 --> 00:27:19
be an easier way at least to get
the basic information out.

384
00:27:16 --> 00:27:22
Okay, let's see if we can get
the basic information out.

385
00:27:20 --> 00:27:26
What are the critical points?
Well, this is pretty easy.

386
00:27:23 --> 00:27:29
A, I want to set the right-hand
side equal to zero.

387
00:27:26 --> 00:27:32
So, I'm going to solve the
equation.

388
00:27:30 --> 00:27:36
I can factor out a y.
It's going to be y times a

389
00:27:35 --> 00:27:41
minus by equals zero.

390
00:27:39 --> 00:27:45
And therefore,
the critical points are where y

391
00:27:43 --> 00:27:49
equals zero. That's one.

392
00:27:47 --> 00:27:53
And, the other factor is when
this factor is zero,

393
00:27:52 --> 00:27:58
and that happens when y is
equal to a over b.

394
00:27:59 --> 00:28:05
So, there are my two critical
points.

395
00:28:03 --> 00:28:09
Okay, what does,
let's start drawing pictures of

396
00:28:08 --> 00:28:14
solutions.
Let's put it in those right

397
00:28:12 --> 00:28:18
away.
Okay, the critical point,

398
00:28:15 --> 00:28:21
zero, gives me a solution that
looks like this.

399
00:28:18 --> 00:28:24
And, the critical point,
a over b,

400
00:28:21 --> 00:28:27
those are positive numbers.
So, that's somewhere up here.

401
00:28:25 --> 00:28:31
So, those are two solutions,
constant solutions.

402
00:28:29 --> 00:28:35
In other words,
if the population by dumb luck

403
00:28:32 --> 00:28:38
started at zero,
it would stay at zero for all

404
00:28:35 --> 00:28:41
time.
That's not terribly surprising.

405
00:28:39 --> 00:28:45
But, it's a little less obvious
that if it starts at that magic

406
00:28:43 --> 00:28:49
number, a over b,
it will also stay at that magic

407
00:28:47 --> 00:28:53
number for all time without
moving up or down or away from

408
00:28:50 --> 00:28:56
it.
Now, the question is,

409
00:28:52 --> 00:28:58
therefore, what happens in
between?

410
00:28:54 --> 00:29:00
So, for the in between,
I'm going to make that same

411
00:28:58 --> 00:29:04
analysis that I made before.
And, it's really not very hard.

412
00:29:03 --> 00:29:09
Look, so here's my dy/dt-axis.
I'll call that y prime,

413
00:29:09 --> 00:29:15
okay?
And, here's the y-axis.

414
00:29:12 --> 00:29:18
So, I'm now doing step two.
This was step one.

415
00:29:16 --> 00:29:22
Okay, the function that I want
to graph is this one,

416
00:29:21 --> 00:29:27
ay minus b y squared,
or in factor form,

417
00:29:26 --> 00:29:32
y times a minus by.

418
00:29:29 --> 00:29:35
Now, this function,
we know, has a zero.

419
00:29:32 --> 00:29:38
It has a zero here,
and it has a zero at the point

420
00:29:37 --> 00:29:43
a over b.
At these two critical points,

421
00:29:43 --> 00:29:49
it has a zero.
What is it doing in between?

422
00:29:46 --> 00:29:52
Well, in between,
it's a parabola.

423
00:29:49 --> 00:29:55
It's a quadratic function.
It's a parabola.

424
00:29:52 --> 00:29:58
Does it go up or does it go
down?

425
00:29:55 --> 00:30:01
Well, when y is very large,
it's very negative.

426
00:29:59 --> 00:30:05
That means it must be a
downward-opening parabola.

427
00:30:04 --> 00:30:10
And therefore,
this curve looks like this.

428
00:30:07 --> 00:30:13
So, I'm interested in knowing,
where is it positive,

429
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
and where is it negative?
Well, it's positive,

430
00:30:16 --> 00:30:22
here, for this range of values
of y.

431
00:30:19 --> 00:30:25
Since it's positive there,
it will be increasing there.

432
00:30:24 --> 00:30:30
Here, it's negative,
and therefore it will be

433
00:30:28 --> 00:30:34
decreasing.
Here, it's negative,

434
00:30:32 --> 00:30:38
and therefore,
dy / dt will be negative also,

435
00:30:36 --> 00:30:42
and therefore the function,
y, will be decreasing here.

436
00:30:41 --> 00:30:47
So, how do these other
solutions look?

437
00:30:44 --> 00:30:50
Well, we can put them in.
I'll put them in in white,

438
00:30:49 --> 00:30:55
okay, because this has got to
last until the end of the term.

439
00:30:54 --> 00:31:00
So, how are they doing?
They are increasing between the

440
00:30:59 --> 00:31:05
two curves.
They are not allowed to cross

441
00:31:04 --> 00:31:10
either of these yellow curves.
But, they are always

442
00:31:08 --> 00:31:14
increasing.
Well, if they're always

443
00:31:11 --> 00:31:17
increasing, they must start here
and increase,

444
00:31:15 --> 00:31:21
and not allowed to cross.
It must do something like that.

445
00:31:19 --> 00:31:25
This must be a translation of
it.

446
00:31:22 --> 00:31:28
In other words,
the curves must look like that.

447
00:31:26 --> 00:31:32
Those are supposed to be
translations of each other.

448
00:31:32 --> 00:31:38
I know they aren't,
but use your imaginations.

449
00:31:35 --> 00:31:41
But what's happening above?
So in other words,

450
00:31:38 --> 00:31:44
if I start with a population
anywhere bigger than zero but

451
00:31:42 --> 00:31:48
less than a over b,
it increases asymptotically to

452
00:31:46 --> 00:31:52
the level a over b.
What happens if I start above

453
00:31:50 --> 00:31:56
that?
Well, then it decreases to it

454
00:31:52 --> 00:31:58
because, this way,
for the values of y bigger than

455
00:31:56 --> 00:32:02
a over b,
it decreases as time increases.

456
00:32:00 --> 00:32:06
So, these guys up here are
doing this.

457
00:32:04 --> 00:32:10
And, how about the ones below
the axis?

458
00:32:06 --> 00:32:12
Well, they have no physical
significance.

459
00:32:09 --> 00:32:15
But let's put them in anyway.
Whether they doing?

460
00:32:12 --> 00:32:18
They are decreasing away from
zero.

461
00:32:15 --> 00:32:21
So, these guys don't mean
anything physically,

462
00:32:18 --> 00:32:24
but mathematically they exist.
Their solutions,

463
00:32:21 --> 00:32:27
they're going down like that.
Now, you notice from this

464
00:32:25 --> 00:32:31
picture that there are,
even though both of these are

465
00:32:29 --> 00:32:35
constant solutions,
they have dramatically

466
00:32:32 --> 00:32:38
different behavior.
This one, this solution,

467
00:32:37 --> 00:32:43
is the one that all other
solutions try to approach as

468
00:32:41 --> 00:32:47
time goes to infinity.
This one, the solution zero,

469
00:32:45 --> 00:32:51
is repulsive,
as it were.

470
00:32:48 --> 00:32:54
Any solution that starts near
zero, if it starts at zero,

471
00:32:52 --> 00:32:58
of course, it stays there for
all time, but if it starts just

472
00:32:58 --> 00:33:04
a little bit above zero,
it increases to a over b.

473
00:33:02 --> 00:33:08
This is called a stable

474
00:33:05 --> 00:33:11
solution because everybody tries
to get closer and closer to it.

475
00:33:11 --> 00:33:17
This is called,
zero is also a constant

476
00:33:14 --> 00:33:20
solution, but this is an
unstable solution.

477
00:33:17 --> 00:33:23
And now, usually,
solution is too general a word.

478
00:33:21 --> 00:33:27
I think it's better to call it
a stable critical point,

479
00:33:26 --> 00:33:32
and an unstable critical point.
But, of course,

480
00:33:30 --> 00:33:36
it also corresponds to a
solution.

481
00:33:34 --> 00:33:40
So, critical points are not all
the same.

482
00:33:37 --> 00:33:43
Some are stable,
and some are unstable.

483
00:33:40 --> 00:33:46
And, you can see which is which
just by looking at this picture.

484
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
If the arrows point towards
them, you've got a stable

485
00:33:51 --> 00:33:57
critical point.
If it arrows point away from

486
00:33:55 --> 00:34:01
them, you've got an unstable
critical point.

487
00:33:58 --> 00:34:04
Now, there is a third
possibility.

488
00:34:03 --> 00:34:09
Okay, I think we'd better
address it because otherwise

489
00:34:09 --> 00:34:15
you're going to sit there
wondering, hey,

490
00:34:13 --> 00:34:19
what did he do?
Suppose it looks like this.

491
00:34:18 --> 00:34:24
Suppose it were just tangent.
Well, this is the picture of

492
00:34:24 --> 00:34:30
that curve, the pink curve.
What would the arrows look like

493
00:34:31 --> 00:34:37
then?
What would the arrows look like

494
00:34:35 --> 00:34:41
then?
Well, since they are positive,

495
00:34:38 --> 00:34:44
it's always positive,
the arrow goes like this.

496
00:34:41 --> 00:34:47
And then on the side,
it also goes in the same

497
00:34:45 --> 00:34:51
direction.
So, is this critical point

498
00:34:47 --> 00:34:53
stable or unstable?
It's stable if you approach it

499
00:34:51 --> 00:34:57
from the left.
So, how, in fact,

500
00:34:53 --> 00:34:59
do the curves,
how would the corresponding

501
00:34:57 --> 00:35:03
curves look?
Well, there's our long-term

502
00:35:00 --> 00:35:06
solution.
This corresponds to that point.

503
00:35:05 --> 00:35:11
Let's call this a,
and then this will be the

504
00:35:10 --> 00:35:16
value, a.
If I start below it,

505
00:35:14 --> 00:35:20
I rise to it.
If I start above it,

506
00:35:18 --> 00:35:24
I increase.
So, if I start above it,

507
00:35:22 --> 00:35:28
I do this.
Well, now, that's stable on one

508
00:35:27 --> 00:35:33
side, and unstable on the other.
And, that's indicated by saying

509
00:35:35 --> 00:35:41
it's semi-stable.
That's a brilliant word.

510
00:35:40 --> 00:35:46
I wonder how long it to do
think that one up,

511
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
semi-stable critical point:
stable on one side,

512
00:35:46 --> 00:35:52
unstable on the other depending
on whether you start below it.

513
00:35:50 --> 00:35:56
And, of course,
it could be reversed if I had

514
00:35:53 --> 00:35:59
drawn the picture the other way.
I could have approached it from

515
00:35:57 --> 00:36:03
the top, and left it from below.
You get the idea of the

516
00:36:03 --> 00:36:09
behavior.
Okay, let's now take,

517
00:36:08 --> 00:36:14
I'm going to soup up this
logistic equation just a little

518
00:36:16 --> 00:36:22
bit more.
So, let's talk about the

519
00:36:21 --> 00:36:27
logistic equation.
But, I'm going to add to it

520
00:36:28 --> 00:36:34
harvesting, with harvesting.
So, this is a very late 20th

521
00:36:36 --> 00:36:42
century concept.
So, we imagine,

522
00:36:39 --> 00:36:45
for example,
a bunch of formerly free range

523
00:36:43 --> 00:36:49
Atlantic salmon penned in one of
these huge factory farms off the

524
00:36:49 --> 00:36:55
coast of Maine or someplace.
They've made salmon much

525
00:36:54 --> 00:37:00
cheaper than it used to be,
but at a certain cost to the

526
00:37:00 --> 00:37:06
salmon, and possibly to our
environment.

527
00:37:05 --> 00:37:11
So, what happens?
Well, the salmon grow,

528
00:37:08 --> 00:37:14
and grow, and do what salmon
do.

529
00:37:11 --> 00:37:17
And, they are harvested.
That's a word somewhere in the

530
00:37:15 --> 00:37:21
category of ethnic cleansing in
my opinion.

531
00:37:19 --> 00:37:25
But, it's, again,
a very 20th-century word.

532
00:37:23 --> 00:37:29
I think it was Hitler who
discovered that,

533
00:37:27 --> 00:37:33
that all you had to do was call
something by a sanitary name,

534
00:37:32 --> 00:37:38
and no matter how horrible it
was, good bourgeois people would

535
00:37:37 --> 00:37:43
accept it.
So, the harvesting,

536
00:37:42 --> 00:37:48
which means,
of course, picking them up and

537
00:37:47 --> 00:37:53
killing them,
and putting them in cans and

538
00:37:52 --> 00:37:58
stuff like that,
okay, so what's the equation?

539
00:37:58 --> 00:38:04
I'm going to assume that the
harvest is at a constant time

540
00:38:05 --> 00:38:11
rate.
In other words,

541
00:38:08 --> 00:38:14
it's not a certain fraction of
all the salmon that are being

542
00:38:13 --> 00:38:19
caught each day and canned.
The factory has a certain

543
00:38:17 --> 00:38:23
capacity, so,
400 pounds of salmon each day

544
00:38:21 --> 00:38:27
are pulled out and canned.
So, it's a constant time rate.

545
00:38:25 --> 00:38:31
That means that the equation is
now going to be dy/dt is equal

546
00:38:31 --> 00:38:37
to, well, salmon grow
logistically.

547
00:38:35 --> 00:38:41
ay minus b y squared, 
so, that part of the

548
00:38:39 --> 00:38:45
equation is the same.
But, I need a term to take care

549
00:38:44 --> 00:38:50
of this constant harvesting
rate, and that will be h.

550
00:38:48 --> 00:38:54
Let's call it h,
not h times y.

551
00:38:50 --> 00:38:56
Then, I would be harvesting a
certain fraction of all the

552
00:38:55 --> 00:39:01
salmon there,
which is not what I'm doing.

553
00:39:00 --> 00:39:06
Okay: our equation.
Now, I want to analyze what the

554
00:39:03 --> 00:39:09
critical points of this look
like.

555
00:39:05 --> 00:39:11
Now, this is a little more
subtle because there's now a new

556
00:39:09 --> 00:39:15
parameter, there.
And, what I want to see is how

557
00:39:12 --> 00:39:18
that varies with the new
parameter.

558
00:39:15 --> 00:39:21
The best thing to do is,
I mean, the thing not to do is

559
00:39:19 --> 00:39:25
make this equal to zero,
fiddle around with the

560
00:39:22 --> 00:39:28
quadratic formula,
get some massive expression,

561
00:39:25 --> 00:39:31
and then spend the next half
hour scratching your head trying

562
00:39:29 --> 00:39:35
to figure out what it means,
and what information you are

563
00:39:33 --> 00:39:39
supposed to be getting out of
it.

564
00:39:37 --> 00:39:43
Draw pictures instead.
Draw pictures.

565
00:39:40 --> 00:39:46
If h is zero,
that's the smallest harvesting

566
00:39:45 --> 00:39:51
rate I could have.
The picture looks like our old

567
00:39:50 --> 00:39:56
one.
So, if h is zero,

568
00:39:52 --> 00:39:58
the picture looks like,
what color did I,

569
00:39:56 --> 00:40:02
okay, pink.
Yellow.

570
00:40:00 --> 00:40:06
Yellow is the cheapest,
but I can't find it.

571
00:40:03 --> 00:40:09
Okay, yellow is commercially
available.

572
00:40:06 --> 00:40:12
These are precious.
All right, purple if it's okay,

573
00:40:11 --> 00:40:17
purple.
So, this is the one,

574
00:40:13 --> 00:40:19
our original one corresponding
to h equals zero.

575
00:40:17 --> 00:40:23
Or, in other words,
it's the equation ay minus b y

576
00:40:21 --> 00:40:27
squared. h is zero.

577
00:40:24 --> 00:40:30
Now, if I want to find,
I now want to increase the

578
00:40:28 --> 00:40:34
value of h, well,
if I increase the value of h,

579
00:40:32 --> 00:40:38
in other words,
harvest more and more,

580
00:40:35 --> 00:40:41
what's happening?
Well, I simply lower this

581
00:40:41 --> 00:40:47
function by h.
So, if I lower h somewhat,

582
00:40:45 --> 00:40:51
it will come to here.
So, this is some value,

583
00:40:49 --> 00:40:55
ay minus b y squared minus h1,

584
00:40:54 --> 00:41:00
let's say.
That's this curve.

585
00:40:57 --> 00:41:03
If I lower it a lot,
it will look like this.

586
00:41:03 --> 00:41:09
So, ay minus b y squared minus
h a lot, h twenty.

587
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
This doesn't mean anything.

588
00:41:11 --> 00:41:17
Two.
Obviously, there's one

589
00:41:14 --> 00:41:20
interesting value to lower it
by.

590
00:41:17 --> 00:41:23
It's a value which would lower
it exactly by this amount.

591
00:41:22 --> 00:41:28
Let me put that in special.
If I lower it by just that

592
00:41:27 --> 00:41:33
amount, the curve always looks
the same.

593
00:41:32 --> 00:41:38
It's just been lowered.
I'm going to say this one is,

594
00:41:36 --> 00:41:42
so this one is the same thing,
except that I've subtracted h

595
00:41:42 --> 00:41:48
sub m. Where is h sub m on

596
00:41:46 --> 00:41:52
the picture?
Well, I lowered it by this

597
00:41:49 --> 00:41:55
amount.
So, this height is h sub m.

598
00:41:53 --> 00:41:59
In other words,
if I find the maximum height

599
00:41:57 --> 00:42:03
here, which is easy to do
because it's a parabola,

600
00:42:01 --> 00:42:07
and lower it by exactly that
amount, I will have lowered it

601
00:42:07 --> 00:42:13
to this point.
This will be a critical point.

602
00:42:12 --> 00:42:18
Now, the question is,
what's happened to the critical

603
00:42:16 --> 00:42:22
point as I did this?
I started with the critical

604
00:42:20 --> 00:42:26
points here and here.
As I lower h,

605
00:42:22 --> 00:42:28
the critical point changed to
this and that.

606
00:42:26 --> 00:42:32
And now, it changed to this one
when I got to the purple line.

607
00:42:32 --> 00:42:38
And, as I went still further
down, there were no critical

608
00:42:36 --> 00:42:42
points.
So, this curve has no critical

609
00:42:38 --> 00:42:44
points attached to it.
What are the corresponding

610
00:42:42 --> 00:42:48
pictures?
Well, the corresponding

611
00:42:44 --> 00:42:50
pictures, well,
we've already drawn,

612
00:42:47 --> 00:42:53
the picture for h equals zero
is drawn already.

613
00:42:51 --> 00:42:57
The pictures that I'm talking
about are how the solutions

614
00:42:55 --> 00:43:01
look.
How would the solution look

615
00:42:57 --> 00:43:03
like for this one for h one?

616
00:43:00 --> 00:43:06
For h1, the solutions look
like, here is a over b.

617
00:43:06 --> 00:43:12
Here is a over b,
but the critical points aren't

618
00:43:10 --> 00:43:16
at zero and a over b anymore.
They've moved in a little bit.

619
00:43:15 --> 00:43:21
So, they are here and here.
And, otherwise,

620
00:43:18 --> 00:43:24
the solutions look just like
they did before,

621
00:43:22 --> 00:43:28
and the analysis is the same.
And, similarly,

622
00:43:25 --> 00:43:31
if h two goes very far,
if h2 is very large,

623
00:43:29 --> 00:43:35
there are no critical points.
h, too large,

624
00:43:33 --> 00:43:39
no critical points.
Are the solutions decreasing

625
00:43:38 --> 00:43:44
all the time or increasing?
Well, they are always

626
00:43:42 --> 00:43:48
decreasing because the function
is always negative.

627
00:43:46 --> 00:43:52
Solutions always go down,
always.

628
00:43:49 --> 00:43:55
The interesting one is this
last one, where I decreased it

629
00:43:54 --> 00:44:00
just to (h)m.
And, what happens there is

630
00:43:57 --> 00:44:03
there is this certain,
magic critical point whose

631
00:44:01 --> 00:44:07
value we could calculate.
There's one constant solution.

632
00:44:07 --> 00:44:13
So, this is one that has the
value.

633
00:44:10 --> 00:44:16
Sorry, I'm calculating the
solutions out.

634
00:44:13 --> 00:44:19
So, y here and t here,
so here it is value,

635
00:44:17 --> 00:44:23
(h)m is the value by which it
has been lowered.

636
00:44:20 --> 00:44:26
So, this is the picture for
(h)m.

637
00:44:23 --> 00:44:29
And, how do the solutions look?
Well, to the right of that,

638
00:44:29 --> 00:44:35
they are decreasing.
And, to the left they are also

639
00:44:33 --> 00:44:39
decreasing because this function
is always negative.

640
00:44:37 --> 00:44:43
So, the solutions look like
this, if you start above,

641
00:44:42 --> 00:44:48
and if you start below,
they decrease.

642
00:44:45 --> 00:44:51
And, of course,
they can't get lower than zero

643
00:44:49 --> 00:44:55
because these are salmon.
What is the significance of

644
00:44:53 --> 00:44:59
(h)m?
(h)m is the maximum rate of

645
00:44:56 --> 00:45:02
harvesting.
It's an extremely important

646
00:44:59 --> 00:45:05
number for this industry.
If the maximum time rate at

647
00:45:05 --> 00:45:11
which you can pull the salmon
daily out of the water,

648
00:45:09 --> 00:45:15
and can them without what
happening?

649
00:45:12 --> 00:45:18
Without the salmon going to
zero.

650
00:45:15 --> 00:45:21
As long as you start above,
and don't harvest it more than

651
00:45:20 --> 00:45:26
this rate, it will be following
these curves.

652
00:45:23 --> 00:45:29
You will be following these
curves, and you will still have

653
00:45:28 --> 00:45:34
salmon.
If you harvest just a little

654
00:45:31 --> 00:45:37
bit more, you will be on this
curve that has no critical

655
00:45:36 --> 00:45:42
points, and the salmon in the
tank will decrease to zero.
