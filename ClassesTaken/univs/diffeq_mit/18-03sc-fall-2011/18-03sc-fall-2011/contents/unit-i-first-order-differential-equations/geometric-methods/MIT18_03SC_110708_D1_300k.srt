DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome back.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,150
So today, I'd like to tackle a
problem on direction fields.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,110
So given a differential
equation, y prime equals

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,400
negative y divided by x squared
plus y squared, we're

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,080
asked to first sketch
the direction field.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,960
And then secondly, given the
curve that goes through y 0

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,360
equal to 1, we're asked several
questions about it.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,820
Why is y of x greater than
0 for x greater than 0?

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,080
And then, why is y of
x decreasing for x

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,120
greater than 0?

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,780
So I'll let you think about
this for a moment

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,030
and I'll get back.

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:47,410

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:47,990
Hi, everyone.

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,650
Welcome back.

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,390
OK, so to start off this
problem, we're asked to sketch

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,880
the direction field.

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,510
Now when asked to sketch a
direction field, the first

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,820
thing to do is to look at
a couple isoclines.

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,930

23
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,890
So what is an isocline?

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,750
Well, it's a curve where the
derivative y prime is equal to

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,665
m, which is some constant.

26
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:19,270

27
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,690
So what are the isoclines for
this differential equation?

28
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,070

29
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,510
Well, it would be minus y
divided by x squared plus y

30
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,660
squared equals m.

31
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,080
Now, of particular interest,
there's a very specialize

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,340
isocline, which is usually
the easiest to plot.

33
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,270

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,550
And that's a nullcline.

35
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,090
And this is just a special case
where m is equal to 0.

36
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,410
So what's the nullcline
for this ODE?

37
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,700
Well, when m is equal to 0, the
only way that y prime can

38
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,903
be 0 is when y is 0.

39
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:04,340

40
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,710
So the nullcline for this
ODE is y equals 0.

41
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,970
Now, for more general isoclines,
we're left with

42
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,440
this relation between x and y.

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,440
And we can massage this
expression to see exactly what

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,690
the isoclines are.

45
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:27,390

46
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,940
So specifically, I'm going to
multiply through by x squared

47
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,780
plus y squared, and I'm
going to divide by m.

48
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,090
And we see that we have a
quadratic in x and y.

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,910
And we have one linear term.

50
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,730
So whenever we have a relation
like this and we want to

51
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,400
understand what it looks like,
typically the approach is just

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,470
to complete the square.

53
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,980
So I'm going to bring the 1 over
m y to the other side of

54
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,230
the equation.

55
00:02:50,230 --> 00:03:00,040

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,740
And I'm going to combine
it with y squared to

57
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,990
complete the square.

58
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:12,780

59
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,990
And when we do this, we obtain
the following equation.

60
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,980
And we recognize this equation
as the equation for a circle.

61
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,730

62
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,620
Specifically, it's a circle
that's centered at x is equal

63
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,520
to 0 and y is equal to
negative 1 over 2m.

64
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,110

65
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,170
And in addition, the circle
has a radius r squared is

66
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,760
equal to 1 over 4m squared,
which means its radius is 1

67
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,900
over 2 times the absolute
value of m.

68
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,540

69
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,310
OK, so why don't we
take a look and

70
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,560
plot a couple isoclines?

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:13,600

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,350
So as I mentioned before,
typically the first isocline

73
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,899
that we should plot is the
nullcline, which is

74
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,420
m is equal to 0.

75
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,810
And we know that this
is y is equal to 0.

76
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,890
So all along the line y is equal
to 0, I'm just going to

77
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:35,050
dry dashes that correspond to
a slope of y is equal to 0.

78
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,400
From the other isoclines, we
just have to pick some values

79
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,760
of m and start plotting.

80
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,170
So I'll take the value m
is equal to negative 1.

81
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,230
And when m is equal to negative
1, we have a circle

82
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,090
which is centered at 0 and
1/2 with radius 1/2.

83
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:59,180

84
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,430
So here's 1/2.

85
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,210

86
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,910
Here's 1.

87
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,420
And at every point along the
circle, we just draw a little

88
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:16,310
slope of negative 1.

89
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,370
So at every point along this
curve, the solution has slope

90
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,320
negative 1.

91
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:31,400
Now, in addition, we can also
get another circle, which is

92
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,200
centered at negative 1/2.

93
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200

94
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,080
And this corresponds to
the isocline of m is

95
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,330
equal to plus 1.

96
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,550

97
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,050
And every point on this circle
has slope plus 1.

98
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,060

99
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,370
Those should all be the same.

100
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,280
And now we can pick some
other values of m.

101
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,520
So for example, m
is equal to 2.

102
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,920
If m is equal to 2, then we
have a circle which is

103
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,330
centered at negative
1/4 and radius 1/4.

104
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,079

105
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,790
So it might look something
like this.

106
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,710
And m is equal to negative
2 might look

107
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,050
something like this.

108
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,640
So this is m is equal
to negative 2.

109
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,966
This is m is equal to 2.

110
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,620

111
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,230
And the slope on this curve
is going to be steeper.

112
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,480
It's going to be negative 2.

113
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,600

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,530
And the same goes
for this circle.

115
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:45,630
And then lastly, I can draw a
sketch of m is equal to 3/4,

116
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,040
which would go up something
like this.

117
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,630

118
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,470
Sorry, m is equal
to negative 3/4.

119
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,300
And that would have a slightly
weaker slope like this.

120
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,110

121
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,640
So notice how the collection of
isoclines are a family of

122
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,030
circles that all are tangent
to the origin.

123
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,680
And in fact, if we think about
it, the nullcline, the m equal

124
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,000
0 line, is actually, in some
sense, a limit circle where we

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,310
take the radius in the center
going to infinity.

126
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,680
So as the circles become larger
and larger, they tend

127
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,030
to approach this line
y equals 0.

128
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,820
So this concludes part one.

129
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,450
So for part two, we're now asked
several questions about

130
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,450
the curve which goes through
y of 0 is equal to 1.

131
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,490
So I'll just sketch
what this solution

132
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,990
curve might look like.

133
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,900
And it's going to start off
at a slope of negative 1.

134
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,560
And then it's going to hit these
circles, which have a

135
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,810
steeper slope.

136
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,910

137
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,350
And then eventually it's going
to go through the circles with

138
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,380
a steeper slope and come back
to the circle that has slope

139
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,350
negative 1.

140
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,660
And eventually, decay
outwards.

141
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,820
So this is what the solution
curve might look like.

142
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:12,080
I'm just sketching this to set
up parts 2a and 2b here.

143
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,430
OK, so why is y of x always
bigger than 0 for x

144
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,500
greater than 0?

145
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,600
Well, we see that this solution
curve stays in the

146
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,650
upper half plane.

147
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:35,460
And we note that y is equal to
0, which is the nullcline, is

148
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,080
actually a very special curve.

149
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,330
Not only is it the nullcline,
but it's actually a solution

150
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,010
to the differential equation.

151
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,020
So if we look back at the
differential equation, we see

152
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,760
that y is equal to 0
has 0 derivative.

153
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,060
And the right-hand side
of the differential

154
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,760
equation is also 0.

155
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,690
So this is not only a nullcline,
but it's a solution

156
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,270
to the differential equation.

157
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,580
Note that this is extremely
special.

158
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,130
In no way does every nullcline
have to be a solution to a

159
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,060
differential equation.

160
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,690
But in this case,
we get lucky.

161
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,360
Now we know from the theory of
ODEs that solution curves

162
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,740
can't cross.

163
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,900
So a solution curve that starts
in the upper half plane

164
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,920
can't cross another solution,
which in this case is the y

165
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,700
equals 0 curve.

166
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,540
Hence, it must be bounded in the
upper half plane for all x

167
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,790
bigger than 0.

168
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,980

169
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,910
The second part, why is y
of x decreasing for x

170
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,800
greater than 0?

171
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,090
Well, what we have to look at--
so I'll just write in

172
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,340
here part 2.

173
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,470

174
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,840
We have to look at the
sign of y prime.

175
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,690
Now y prime is equal to negative
y divided by x

176
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,590
squared plus y squared.

177
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,350
So as I've just argued, a
solution that starts in the

178
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,960
upper half plane and goes
through the point y of 0 is

179
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,320
equal to 1, stays in the upper
half plane for all

180
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,600
x bigger than 0.

181
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,920
What this means is that the
solution curve has y bigger

182
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,570
than 0 for all x
bigger than 0.

183
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,940
So that means the numerator
is always positive.

184
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,510

185
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,130
The denominator is also
always positive.

186
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,230
So we have negative a positive
number divided

187
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,770
by a positive number.

188
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,120
And so this quantity is always
going to be less than 0.

189
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,250
So for x bigger than 0, y prime
is always going to be

190
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,500
less than 0.

191
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,160
Hence, the solution that starts
at y of 0 is equal to 1

192
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,110
is going to monotonically decay
to y is equal to 0.

193
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,810
OK?

194
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,840
So this concludes the problem.

195
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,250
Now just to recap, we
were given an ODE.

196
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,290
The standard approach when
sketching direction fields is

197
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,020
to pick a few nullclines.

198
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,560
Or to pick a few isoclines.

199
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,010
And specifically pick
the nullcline.

200
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,500
Sketch the isoclines.

201
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,940
And then, if you're asked to
plot any integral curves or

202
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,610
solutions to the differential
equation, you just simply

203
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,540
connect the dots.

204
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,950
OK, so I'd like to conclude
here, and I'll

205
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,200
see you next time.

206
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,501
