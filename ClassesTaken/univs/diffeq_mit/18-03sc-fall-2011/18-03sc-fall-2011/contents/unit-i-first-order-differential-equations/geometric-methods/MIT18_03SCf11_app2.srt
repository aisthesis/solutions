00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
PROFESSOR: The isoclines
applet.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,700
Let's explore graphs of
solutions of differential

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,960
equations using direction
fields and isoclines.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,140
The first thing to do is to
choose an equation from the

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,570
pull down menu here.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,570
And for this demonstration, I
will choose the differential

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,650
equation y prime equals
y squared minus x.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,160
In the window at left, you can
see the direction or slope

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,530
field drawn.

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,509
This is a representation of
the differential equation.

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:38,480
When I move the cursor over this
window, a readout of the

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,500
x- and y-coordinates shows
up on the right

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,370
hand side of the screen.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,640
This is very useful in
making measurements.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,250
If I click on the graphing
window, the solution through

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,680
the point that I've clicked
on is drawn.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,090
This is an interesting function,
probably one you've

18
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,420
never seen before.

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,760
Certainly, it's not an
elementary function.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,519
Clicking some more points makes
more solutions appear.

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,640

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,980
In fact, every point on this
plane has exactly one solution

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,930
through it.

24
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,910
This is the meaning of the
existence and uniqueness

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:24,330
theorem for differential
equations.

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,500
Now, let's clear the solutions
using this button down here,

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,140
Clear Solutions button.

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,330
You see a blank screen again.

29
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,180
You can control how the slope
field looks by using this

30
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,080
Slope Field toggle here.

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,420
You can make them blank,
or bright for a

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,530
display, for example.

33
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,300
Or the way it was originally.

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,590
And I think I'm going to turn
it off altogether, so now

35
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,110
we're faced with
a blank screen.

36
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,220
Now, how would you go about
drawing some solutions to this

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,590
differential equation by hand
just knowing the differential

38
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,410
equation and this
blank screen?

39
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,960

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,750
Well, isoclines give you a good
way of doing this, and

41
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,340
they reveal things about the
qualitative behavior of the

42
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,560
differential equation as well.

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,160
An isocline is the subset of
the plane where the slope

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,010
field takes on a given value.

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,380
I can choose that value, m,
using this slider here.

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,650
And when I click here and move
this, the isocline with the

47
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,690
given value of m is drawn
in yellow on the screen.

48
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,520
And you can see the value of the
slope field drawn as well.

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,950
So here is the value is 1, and
the slope field is given by

50
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,950
little intervals of value
1 of slope 1.

51
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,340
I can choose that value using
the slider marked m.

52
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,590
If I click on the handle and
drag it, you see the isocline

53
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,750
for the corresponding value
of m drawn on the screen.

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,170
And on the isocline is also
drawn the direction fields.

55
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,610
So when m is 2, the direction
field has slope 2.

56
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,780
And when I drag the slider back
down to 0, the isocline

57
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,920
value 0 has a horizontal
direction field

58
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,720
marked along it.

59
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,740
Each one of these is a curve
where y squared minus x equals

60
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,370
m, or x equals y squared
minus m.

61
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,280
This is a parabola lying on its
side with the vertex at x

62
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,870
equals negative m.

63
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,340
Let's draw out to the isocline
for value 1, for example.

64
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,640
I've now released the
mouse key, and the

65
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,300
isocline is left behind.

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,110
And I can easily draw in some
other isoclines as well by

67
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,660
clicking on different
values of m and

68
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,910
releasing the mouse key.

69
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,790

70
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,260
So once you've drawn several
of these isoclines on the

71
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:03,560
plane, it's pretty easy to
envision what the solutions

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,940
will look like to this curve.

73
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,670
You just have to thread your
way along the part of the

74
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,830
direction field that
you've drawn.

75
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,070
I can check that by clicking
on the screen and drawing a

76
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,220
solution in.

77
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,970
This is quite easy
to do by hand.

78
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,760
It's easy to draw the isoclines
and then sketch a

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,010
solution accordingly.

80
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,270

81
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,525
But you can see other things
as well from isoclines.

82
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:35,270
I'm going to clear all of these
and redraw the m equals

83
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,895
0 isocline on the screen.

84
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,430

85
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,400
And I think I'm going
to redraw the

86
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,760
slope field as well.

87
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,870
Now, critical points of a
function occur where the

88
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,180
derivative is equal to 0.

89
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,900
And the derivative is exactly
what we know about the

90
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,140
solution to a differential
equation.

91
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,630
So the critical points, the
minima or maxima of solutions

92
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,370
to this differential equation,
occur when the solution

93
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,240
crosses the m equals
0 isocline, also

94
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,040
known as the nullcline.

95
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,640
All maxima and minima of
solutions to this differential

96
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,840
equation occur along this
particular yellow parabola.

97
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,140
I can check that by drawing in
some solutions, and you can

98
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:30,510
see that these functions have
maxima which occur just along

99
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,870
that parabola.

100
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,570
If the solutions miss the
parabola, they don't have any

101
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,820
critical points.

102
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,890

103
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,210
Another thing you can see from
this picture is that

104
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,040
apparently many of the solutions
to this differential

105
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,550
equation cluster near to this
branch of the nullcline.

106
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,070
And maybe we can see why this is
using the isocline picture.

107
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,030
I'm going to clear the solutions
now to make the

108
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,920
picture clearer and draw in one
more isocline, namely the

109
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,100
m equals minus 1 isocline.

110
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,000

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,240
Now, suppose that a solution
finds itself below the m

112
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,120
equals minus 1 isocline.

113
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,540
So it's in here somewhere.

114
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,850
Can it ever across the m equals
minus 1 isocline?

115
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,460
Once it's below it, can
it ever cross it?

116
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,410
Well, it's below it.

117
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,960
So if it crosses the m equals
minus 1 isocline, it must

118
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,680
cross it with a slope which is
bigger than the slope of that

119
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,190
yellow curve.

120
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,870
But when it crosses it, it
also has to cross it with

121
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:55,750
slope minus 1, because this is
the m equals minus 1 isocline.

122
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,650
But the slope of this yellow
parabola is bigger than minus

123
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,540
1 along here, and so
the solution curve

124
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,390
can never cross it.

125
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,230
Similarly, suppose that you have
a solution which is above

126
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,560
the nullcline.

127
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,490
Can it ever cross
the nullcline?

128
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,690
Well, if it crosses the
nullcline, it must cross it

129
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,400
from above, so when it crosses
it, its slope must be less

130
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,830
than the slope of the nullcline,
which is negative

131
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,330
as you can see.

132
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,660
But when the solution crosses
the nullcline, it must cross

133
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,940
it with slope 0.

134
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,450
And so, that can't happen.

135
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,980
And so you see, if a solution
is between those two

136
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,280
isoclines, then it stays between
them forever more.

137
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,260
It's trapped between them.

138
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,666
This is called a funnel.

139
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,550
It's trapped between these two
things, and gets closer and

140
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,640
closer because these two
isoclines become asymptotic as

141
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,440
x gets large.

142
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,550
These are called
fences as well.

143
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,460
Once a solution is in here, it
can't cross either of these

144
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,480
two fences.

145
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,325
This let's us estimate
the value of

146
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:18,100
solutions for large x.

147
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,260
These solutions, anyway,
for large x.

148
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,520

149
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,730
For example, if x is equal to
100, the solution has to be

150
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:33,770
bigger than the value of this
parabola, which is minus 10,

151
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,270
and less than the value along
this parabola, which is minus

152
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,809
the square root of 99.

153
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,990
So you get a very good estimate
for the value of

154
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,591
solutions for large x from these
kinds of considerations.

155
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:51,490
One more thing you can see
from this applet is this.

156
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,920
If a solution is well above the
nullcline, cline, it gets

157
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,200
caught in this powerful updraft

158
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,450
and goes off to infinity.

159
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,160
In fact, all these solutions
become tangent to

160
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,130
the vertical lines.

161
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,280
They don't continue
for all large x.

162
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,230
They blow up in finite time.

163
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,690
On the other hand, if you're
just a little bit smaller than

164
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,800
these solutions, then you get
solutions which cross the

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,240
nullcline, get trapped into this
parabolic region and fall

166
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,210
down in between our funnel,
down here, and so become

167
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:38,450
asymptotic to minus the square
root of x when x gets large.

168
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,620
There's just one solution which
doesn't do either of

169
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,510
these very different behaviors,
and it's right

170
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,770
along here.

171
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,030
It becomes asymptotic to the
positive branch of the

172
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,670
parabola, and every solution
above it blows up in finite

173
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,230
time, and every solution below
it falls down and becomes

174
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,200
asymptotic to minus the
square root of x.

175
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,440
This special solution--

176
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,070
which doesn't do either of
those two behaviors, but

177
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,500
continues to exist for all
positive values of x and

178
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,250
become asymptotic to the
square root of x--

179
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,550
this is called the separatrix.

180
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,660
It separates solutions showing
two very different types of

181
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,920
behavior, the ones that
fall down and the

182
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,704
ones that blow up.

183
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:27,210
Well, these are just a few of
the things you can understand

184
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,460
using this applet.

185
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,080

186
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,640
Play with different
menu items.

187
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,365
Open a copy of this applet
in your browser window.

188
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:36,840
Play with some other
menu items.

189
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,270
Maybe the default item at
the bottom of this pull

190
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,100
down menu down here.

191
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,150
Are there funnels?

192
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,380
Are there separatrices?

193
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,150
What happens to solutions as x
goes to minus infinity rather

194
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,350
than x equals plus infinity?

195
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,780
Where are the critical points of
solutions of this equation?

196
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,234
