1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,784

2
00:00:05,784 --> 00:00:06,760
PROFESSOR: Hi.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,220
Today we'll explore the complex

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,770
numbers and Euler formula.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,740
So the first part of the problem
is to write this

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,110
complex number minus 2 plus
3i in polar form.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,190
And at this point, it's
written in rectangular

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,270
coordinate form.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,750
The second question asks you
to do the reverse, to write

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,680
three exponential to the i
pi over 6 in rectangular

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,390
coordinate form.

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,080
Question c asks you to draw
and label the triangle

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,759
relating the rectangular
coordinates to the polar

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,310
coordinate form.

15
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,760
D asks you to compute 1 over
this reverse complex number

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,670
that we already saw
in question a.

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,590
And e asks you to find
the cube root of 1.

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,030
And in all these questions,
you'll be using Euler formula.

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,680
So why don't you pause the
video, take a few minutes to

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,220
work out the problem,
and we'll come back.

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:01:00,200

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,060
Welcome back.

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,900
So we're asked throughout the
problem to go back and forth

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,850
between coordinates in polar
form and in rectangular form.

25
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:18,220
So a key thing to remember is
Euler formula from the start.

26
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,542
So we're just going to
write it up here.

27
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:25,352

28
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,320
It allows us to express a
complex exponential into the

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,250
sum of its cosine plus
i sine theta.

30
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,660
So how do we tactical
question a?

31
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:42,460
Question a gives us a complex
number in rectangular form.

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,840
So in this form, a plus i b.

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,690
And we're asked to write it in
polar form, which introduces

34
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,470
the modulus of the complex
number r and its phase theta.

35
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:05,150
So r, modulus of the complex
number that we can compute

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,220
when we know its rectangular
form, with its real form

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,530
squared plus imaginary part
squared, the whole

38
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,660
thing under the root.

39
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,570
So in this case, we
have four plus 9.

40
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,900
So we end up with root of 13
for the modulus of the

41
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,230
complex number z.

42
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,070
So now for the phase.

43
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,970
Using Euler formula, we can
see that we can relate the

44
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,590
rectangular form to the polar
form by just introducing--

45
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:43,040

46
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,290
I'm going to keep r.

47
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,640

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,750
And you can see now that we can
extract the sine and the

49
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,090
cosine of the angle theta and
relate that to a ratio of a.

50
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,940
And the modulus r that we just
found, b modulus r that we

51
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,700
just found.

52
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:09,540
Or in one move, just express it
as the tangent of the angle

53
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:17,000
theta, just sine over the
cosine, just becomes basically

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,250
b over a, which we have here.

55
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,590

56
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,600
So we have the modulus r, which
is now root of 13, and

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,090
the angle theta that we can
now extract by using the

58
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,560
reverse of the function 10.

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,940
So just before we move to the
next question, this is not one

60
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,990
of the classical angles
that you learned.

61
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,490
So just to have an idea of where
this angle lies on the

62
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:01,010
trigonometric unit circle, just
recall here that the sine

63
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,310
is positive and the cosine of
this angle is negative.

64
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:13,560
So we're bound to be in this
region, where basically theta

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,260
is between pi and pi over 2.

66
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,244
And that's the answer
to question a.

67
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:24,970

68
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,210
So now for question b, we're
asked to do the reverse,

69
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:35,980
expressing the polar number 3i
pi over 6 in rectangular

70
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,020
coordinates.

71
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,760
So now this is just a
straightforward application of

72
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,810
the Euler formula that
we just saw.

73
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,910
By just expanding the
exponential, as I already

74
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,160
wrote there.

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,110

76
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:59,080
Plus i3 sine pi over 6.

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,630

78
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:08,850
And on the same trigonometric
circle here, that's roughly

79
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,720
where pi over 6 lie.

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,560
And you can just re-express this
as 3, root of 3 over 2,

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,820
plus i, 3 over 2.

82
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,390
So that answers the solution
for question b.

83
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,640
So now question c.

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,570

85
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,350
Let me just add a line here.

86
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,320
Question c we're asked to draw
and label the triangle

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,690
relating rectangular to
polar coordinates.

88
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,590
So that's what we already had
a sense with when we wrote

89
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,910
this formula going from
a plus i b to r

90
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,090
exponential of i theta.

91
00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:03,070
So in the complex plane, we
have the real axis, an

92
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:12,800
imaginary axis, and a complex
number lying on this plane

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,300
written in this form in a
rectangular coordinate.

94
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,380

95
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,420
You'd have a projection of a in
the real axis, projection

96
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,130
of value b on the
imaginary axis.

97
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:36,390
And in polar form this would
be its modulus or distance

98
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:44,130
from the origin, and its phase
theta that would come in the

99
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,380
polar form.

100
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,470

101
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,160
So that's the triangle that
allows us to go back and forth

102
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,090
between the rectangular
and polar coordinates.

103
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:05,140
So to almost finish, question
d now asks us to compute the

104
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,600
reverse of the original complex
number that we used.

105
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,830

106
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,710
So 1 over minus 2 plus 3i.

107
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,500
So to do this, we can stay in
rectangular form and basically

108
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,540
multiply the numerator and
denominator by the complex

109
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,530
conjugate of the number.

110
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,440
But clearly now that we learned
how to use polar

111
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,220
coordinate expressions of this
number, it's much easier to

112
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,750
just write it directly
in this form.

113
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:44,970

114
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,070
In one step we basically arrived
to the results, where

115
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:58,420
we express that the angle
was the reverse 10 of

116
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,530
minus 3 over 2.

117
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,600
And that's done.

118
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,880
So now are for the last
question, we were asked to

119
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,400
compute the one third
root of 1.

120
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,260
So basically, 1 to one third.

121
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,220
So here, obviously,
we're treating 1

122
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,310
as a complex number.

123
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:27,980
And if we go in the complex
plane and I just introduce

124
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,169
here the number 1, we see that
in polar form 1 is just

125
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,780
basically a complex number with
modulus 1, and angle 0

126
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,919
modulus 2pi.

127
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:50,550
So we can write 1 as exponential
2 n pi, because

128
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,450
it's basically angle
0 modulus 2pi.

129
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,330

130
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,830
And from here we know that we're
looking at third roots,

131
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,240
so we're going to have
three roots.

132
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,670
And these roots are going to be
expressed by changing the

133
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,690
value of n.

134
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,040
First one, n equals to 0 is
just going to give us back

135
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,440
root of 1, because we're going
to have exponential

136
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,260
to 0 is just 1.

137
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,950
Power of one third is just 1.

138
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,490
n equals to 1.

139
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:32,240
We are going to have exponential
of 2pi over 3,

140
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:40,970
which we can express again using
the Euler formula, also

141
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,220
in coordinate form.

142
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,360

143
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,430
And then just write
down the values.

144
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:58,020
And for the third root we take
the value n equals to 2, so we

145
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:13,810
have i 4 pi over 3, which again
we can express as the

146
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,790
cosine plus the sine
of 4pi over 3.

147
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,150
So where do these roots lie?

148
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,440
So we have root 1 for
n equals to 0.

149
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,300
The second root exponential 2pi
over 3, basically in polar

150
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,660
form would be here, where
we would have the

151
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,170
angle 2pi over 3.

152
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,500
So 1pi over 2 would here.

153
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,140
2pi over 3 would be here.

154
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,380
3pi over 3 would be here.

155
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,730
And 4pi over 3 is our third
root, it would be here.

156
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:52,440

157
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,920
So then we can just write
down the values.

158
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,680
And you can do that when you
know the angles, or just keep

159
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,170
it in either form when you
don't know their overall

160
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,650
expression for the angles.

161
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,290
So this completes the problems
in all of these problems what

162
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,820
we kept using is Euler formula
to go back and forth between

163
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,090
coordinate in rectangular form
to expression of complex

164
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,450
number in polar form.

165
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,840
And that's the key formula
that we kept using.

166
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,850
And you'll be using this
repeatedly when we will be

167
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,260
solving other ODEs for which we
can use complex number as a

168
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,030
trick for solutions.

169
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,280
And this ends this session.

170
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,898
