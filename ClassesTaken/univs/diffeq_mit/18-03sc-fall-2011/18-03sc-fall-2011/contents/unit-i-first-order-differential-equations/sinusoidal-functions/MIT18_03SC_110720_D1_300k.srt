1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,290

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,760
PROFESSOR: So today we're
going to take a look at

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,020
sinusoidal functions.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,380
And specifically, we're going to
use complex numbers to get

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,250
a handle on sinusoidal
functions.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,910
The reason is complex numbers
provide a robust way of

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,820
analyzing sinusoidal
functions.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
So specifically, we're
interested in this function, e

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,120
to the i omega t divided
by 2 plus 3i.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,990
And we're asked to write the
real part of this function

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,150
using polar form and then
rectangular form.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,830
And then secondly, we're asked
several properties of this

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,250
function, the real part
of this function.

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,240
What's the circular frequency?

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,150
What's the amplitude?

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,390
And what's the phase lag?

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,130
And then lastly, we're asked
to sketch the real part of

18
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,310
this function versus time.

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,290
So I'll let you take a look at
this and try it for yourself.

20
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,540
And I'll come back
in a moment.

21
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:07,912

22
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:09,070
Hi everyone.

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,380
Welcome back.

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:10,660
OK.

25
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,910
So let's take a look
at this problem.

26
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:19,120
So we're asked to write e to i
omega t divided by 2 plus 3i.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,850

28
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,730
We're asked to write the real
part of this function, using

29
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,290
polar form and then also
rectangular form.

30
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,930
So I'll first start off
with polar form.

31
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,900

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,460
And if we take a look at this
function, we see that the

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
numerator is already written
in polar form.

34
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,600
So just recall that polar
form is of the form

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,680
r e to the i theta.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,950

37
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,190
Meanwhile, the denominator is
written in Cartesian form, or

38
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,040
rectangular form.

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,240
So we need to convert this
into polar form.

40
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,710
So what we can do is we
can write 2 plus 3i.

41
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,470
We can combine these
two into a modulus.

42
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,740
And the modulus is going to be
the square root of 2 squared

43
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,990
plus 3 squared.

44
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,430

45
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,890
So this is the modulus of
the complex number.

46
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,660
And then we have
e to the i phi.

47
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:34,610
And the angle phi we can deduce
by writing a triangle,

48
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,780
which is over to the right
by two units, and

49
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,830
then it's up two units.

50
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,590
And this is the angle phi.

51
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:52,560
So we see from the triangle
that the tangent of phi is

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,810
equal to 3/2.

53
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,620

54
00:02:59,620 --> 00:02:59,850
OK.

55
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,580
So putting the pieces together,
we have e to the i

56
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:15,470
omega t divided by root
13 e to i phi.

57
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,240
And the beautiful thing about
polar form is that when we

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,800
divide and multiply these
complex exponentials, it just

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,050
turns into a simple addition or
subtraction of the phases.

60
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:32,720

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:41,750
So we have 1 over root 13, e
to the i omega t minus phi.

62
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,360
So we've successfully combined
all the terms

63
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,090
into one polar term.

64
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,590
And then now we're asked to
compute the real part.

65
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,940
And here we use Euler's
formula.

66
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:59,790
So just to recall Euler's
formula, we

67
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,011
have e to the i theta.

68
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:11,380
Then this is equal to cosine
theta plus i sine theta.

69
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:20,990

70
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,790
OK?

71
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,840
So at the end of the day, we're
interested in the real

72
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,450
part-- and I'm going to use this
notation Re with a curly

73
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,130
bracket to denote
the real part--

74
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,480
of 1 over root 13.

75
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,180
And I'll use Euler's formula
on e to the i

76
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,100
omega t minus phi.

77
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:48,730
So we have cosine omega t
minus phi plus i sine

78
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,040
omega t minus phi.

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,310

80
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,420
Sorry.

81
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,275
1 over root 13 is multiplying
both the sign and the cosine.

82
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:04,990

83
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,960
And we see that the second
term is purely imaginary.

84
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,010
So when we take the real part
of a real number plus an

85
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,590
imaginary number, we just are
left with the real number at

86
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,840
the end of the day.

87
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,700

88
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,860
So the answer we're looking for
is 1 over root 13 cosine

89
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:36,310
omega t minus phi, where
from before phi is the

90
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,560
arctangent of 3/2.

91
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,670

92
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,620
And phi can also be thought of
the angle being between zero

93
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,170
and pi over 2.

94
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,510
OK.

95
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,880
So this concludes the polar
form computation.

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,570
Secondly, we also have to
compute this using a

97
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,180
rectangular form calculation.

98
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:13,970
So let's do the calculation
in rectangular form.

99
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,900
And for this, I'm going to use
Euler's formula to expand out

100
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,150
the numerator.

101
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,040

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,590
So first, we want to take the
real part of the numerator is

103
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,850
cosine omega t plus
i sine omega t.

104
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,040

105
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,380
The denominator was 2 plus 3i.

106
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,500

107
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,830
And typically what we want to
do is we want to turn the

108
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,570
denominator into an entirely
real number.

109
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,090
So what we do is we multiply
the top and bottom by the

110
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:01,210
complex conjugate of
the denominator.

111
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,280
So for example, I
have 2 plus 3i.

112
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,280
So I'm going to multiply the top
and bottom by 2 minus 3i.

113
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:13,620

114
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,170
OK.

115
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,470
And when I do this, you'll note
that when we multiply out

116
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,490
two plus 3i and 2 minus 3i we
have a difference of squares.

117
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,640
So we're left with
2 times 2 is 4.

118
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,690
The cross terms cancel.

119
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,830
And then we have 3i
times negative 3i.

120
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,980
That's going to give us
negative 9i squared,

121
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,230
which is plus 9.

122
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,510

123
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,770
So the denominator is going
to be 4 plus 9.

124
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,990

125
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,020
And then the numerator--

126
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,510
I'll write out all the terms
just for completeness--

127
00:07:50,510 --> 00:08:00,800
it'll be 2 times cosine omega
t plus 3 sine omega t.

128
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:10,330

129
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,060
And then now we have some
imaginary terms, which are

130
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:23,670
negative 3 cosine omega t
and plus 2 sine omega t.

131
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,460

132
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,710
OK?

133
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,210

134
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,840
But now we're going to
take the real part of

135
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,100
this complex function.

136
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,850
And if we take a look
at it, this first

137
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,000
term is entirely real.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,820
This second term is entirely
complex because we're

139
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,120
multiplying by an i.

140
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,160
So when we take the real part,
at the end of the day, the

141
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,940
second term is going
to drop out.

142
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:59,040

143
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:07,510
So when the dust settles, we
have 1/13 2 times cosine omega

144
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,640
t plus 3 sine omega t.

145
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,240

146
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,700
OK?

147
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,440
So this concludes Part A.

148
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,930
For Part B, we're asked several
questions about this

149
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:34,040
sinusoidal function when written
in its real form,

150
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,120
specifically, what's the
circular frequency.

151
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,470

152
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,440
And the circular frequency is
just the frequency that this

153
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,080
function oscillates at.

154
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,180
And we can get this from looking
at the rectangular

155
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,360
form or the polar form.

156
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,350
And it's simply just
going to be omega.

157
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,870
So note how this function
oscillates

158
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,120
with frequency omega.

159
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,780

160
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,575
Secondly, we're asked
about the amplitude.

161
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:16,410

162
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,810
And if we take a look at it,
the amplitude is a little

163
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,680
tricky to get from the
rectangular form, but it's

164
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,920
completely apparent from
the polar form.

165
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,820
So if we take a look at the
polar form, we have 1 over

166
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,000
root 13 cosine omega
t minus phi.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,340
And cosine oscillates between
plus 1 and minus 1.

168
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,830
So this function takes on a
maximum value of plus 1 over

169
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,990
root 13 and a maximum
negative value of

170
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,150
negative 1 over root 13.

171
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,950
So the amplitude of this
function is just going to be 1

172
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,790
over root 13.

173
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,120
And then lastly,
the phase lag.

174
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,940

175
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,860
This is the angle that the
cosine is picked up and

176
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,110
shifted over.

177
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,680

178
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:19,100
So again, we can get this
directly from the polar form.

179
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,750
Meanwhile, it's a little less
obvious what this angle is

180
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,570
when we take a look at
the rectangular form.

181
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:33,480
So in our case, the phase lag is
just going to be phi, which

182
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,250
is 10 inverse 3/2.

183
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:38,660
OK?

184
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,960
So this concludes Part B.

185
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,960
And then lastly, for Part C
we're just asked to sketch

186
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,210
this diagram.

187
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,320

188
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:58,710
And again, the most direct way
at sketching this function is

189
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,600
through the polar form.

190
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,300
So I'll write time
on this axis.

191
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,510

192
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,840
And if we just recall that
a cosine might look

193
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,090
something like this.

194
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,470

195
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,150
So this is a cosine function.

196
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,730

197
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,560
And in our case, we're looking
at plotting 1 over root 13

198
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,200
cosine omega t minus phi.

199
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,570
So we're interested in a cosine
which has an amplitude

200
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,910
of 1 over root 13 and a maximum
negative value of

201
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:49,170
minus 1 over root 13 whose
frequency is omega.

202
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:55,050
So there's a quick way
on finding zeros.

203
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,550
So if the zero of a regular
cosine is at pi over 2, then

204
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,000
if we have an angular frequency
of omega, the zero

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,730
here is going to be
pi over 2 omega.

206
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,910
And this zero is going to
be at 3 pi over 2 omega.

207
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,970

208
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,070
And lastly, this is not
necessarily the

209
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,970
cosine of our function.

210
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,770
Our function is this cosine.

211
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,480
However it must be picked
up and shifted over by

212
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,560
some phase lag phi.

213
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,390
So in our case, the function
we're actually looking for is

214
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,080
some shifted cosine, which
looks like this.

215
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:42,330

216
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,865
And this distance here
is phi over omega.

217
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:51,772

218
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:52,440
OK?

219
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,250
So this just gives us a quick
sketch of this function.

220
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,840
And again, we note that we were
able to plot this using

221
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,850
the polar form very quickly.

222
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,720
And the reason is because the
polar form gives us the

223
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,320
amplitude, the circular
frequency, and the phase lag.

224
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,380
Whereas if we were to take
a look at the equivalent

225
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,720
rectangular form, it's a
little less obvious.

226
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,290
The rectangular form is
actually the sum of

227
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,790
a sine and a cosine.

228
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,320
And unless you can just add
sines and cosines in your head

229
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,600
very quickly, it's a little less
obvious on how to come up

230
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,730
with this picture.

231
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,360
OK.

232
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,910
So just to summarize, we've
used complex functions to

233
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,390
analyze sinusoidal functions.

234
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,100
And we've used polar form and
rectangular form to get a

235
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,210
handle on the complex
functions.

236
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,210
And specifically, complex
functions are a very good way

237
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,220
to represent sinusoidal
functions.

238
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,970
And just to reiterate, the
reason is that they contain a

239
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,010
lot of information that we can
graphically handle and turn

240
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,710
into a sketch.

241
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,130
So I'll just conclude there,
and I'll see you next time.

242
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,380
