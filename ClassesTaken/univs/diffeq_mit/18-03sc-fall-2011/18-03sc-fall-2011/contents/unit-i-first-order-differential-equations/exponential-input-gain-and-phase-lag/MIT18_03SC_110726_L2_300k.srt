00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,990

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,350
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,340
So in this session, we're going
to look at sinusoidal

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,070
inputs for ordinary
differential

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,330
equations of order one.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,520
So here in question one, you're
asked to use complex

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,400
techniques to solve x dot plus
kx equals cosine of omega t.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,730
Here k and omega
are constants.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,560
This is of ODE of first order.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,150
And the sinusoidal input is
referring to the right-hand

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,440
side of the ODE where basically
the we are forcing a

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,710
system with a function and
its sinusoidal of angular

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,510
frequency omega, which
means basically a

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,260
period of 2pi over omega.

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,220
So you're asked to use complex
techniques to solve this in

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,920
question a.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,210
In question b, we're asked to
use what we had in question a

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,000
to solve this modified function,
where again, we have

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,200
a sinusoidal input on the
right-hand side with an

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,130
additional amplitude F,
which is now constant.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,230
In the third part, we're asked
to use superposition principle

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,940
to solve this combined equation,
where now we're

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,930
introducing a value for example
for F, which is 3.

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,380
And you can see also that the
right-hand side is also a

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,300
sinusoidal input, because it's
a linear combination of

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,630
sinusoidal functions.

27
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,230
All these equations are linear
with constant coefficients,

28
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,170
and hence superposition
principle would hold.

29
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,730
So why don't you stop the video,
take a few minutes, and

30
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,613
work through the problems.
And we'll be back.

31
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:40,710

32
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,170
Welcome back.

33
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,590
So what is it that we're
asked to do here?

34
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,950
We're asked to solve this using
a trick that you learned

35
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,470
in class to basically convert
a real valued ODE into a

36
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,050
complex form.

37
00:01:53,050 --> 00:02:04,710
So the first thing to do is to
realize that the cosine of

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:12,820
omega t is simply the real part
of the imaginary complex

39
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,920
exponential i omega t.

40
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,670
So when we realize that, and
we see that the ODE is real

41
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:37,040
valued linear, we can convert
its real value ODE into this

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,538
complex valued ODE.

43
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:55,040

44
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,030
And we're going to label
this equation star.

45
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,590

46
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,740
From this point, we can go back
to the techniques that we

47
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,050
learned in class, namely the
integrating factor, to realize

48
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,960
that we can rewrite the
right-hand side in this form,

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,190
introducing a new function u,
so that we need to seek a

50
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,090
function u that will
then recover this

51
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,885
function, this equation.

52
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:22,400

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,430
And from previous recitations
and problem, we saw that

54
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,590
clearly the u that we would
need to pick is just

55
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,160
exponential of kt.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:45,770
So now from this, basically
we're back to i omega plus k

57
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,925
the whole thing t on the
right-hand side, and here zu

58
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:53,930
prime that we just need to
integrate on both sides.

59
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:00,510
So this is simply kt z on
the left-hand side.

60
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,260
And on the right hand side,
we're integrating--

61
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,466
again, it's still
an exponential,

62
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:07,716
even though it's complex.

63
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:14,690

64
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,870
And we need to introduce,
of course, constant of

65
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,120
integration.

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,980

67
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,795
So the solution for the equation
star is then, I'm

68
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:29,000
going to write it up here, that
we keep that for the rest

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,080
of the problem, minus t minus
kt when I divide by this.

70
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,070
And here, the minus kt of this
exponential is going to be

71
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,770
canceled out by the integrating
factor.

72
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:54,530

73
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,020
So we need to keep that here.

74
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,510
So here I gave the general
solution with the solution

75
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,170
that would come from the
homogeneous equation, which

76
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,210
could refer to also as a
transient here, because

77
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,580
basically after a long time, t,
this exponential, if k is

78
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,940
positive, would decay.

79
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,150
And the part of the solution
that comes from the sinusoidal

80
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,450
input, or the forcing, which
would be particular solution.

81
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,330
So to go back to the original
question, we were asked to

82
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,300
solve this real valued
equation.

83
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,380
So from what we noticed above,
we saw that the right-hand

84
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,180
side is just a real part of
the right-hand side of the

85
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,390
complex value equation star.

86
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:43,100
And similarly then, we can do
the same for the actual

87
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,590
solutions themselves.

88
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,210
x is also just a real value
of this complex number.

89
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,830
So here, for this general
solution, I'm going to just

90
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,210
use c bar for general complex
constant here.

91
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,420
And in this case, we will
take the real value.

92
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,430
So at this point, it doesn't
really matter what t is.

93
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,580
It's just we're going to
keep it as a constant.

94
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,290
And now it's just real valued.

95
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,670
That's for the one part.

96
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:15,640
And then we need to take the
real part of this expression.

97
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,360
Come back to the line here.

98
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,350
So to take the real part of this
expression, you learned

99
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,730
that basically you just need to
multiply the denominator or

100
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,705
the numerator by the
complex conjugate.

101
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:32,160

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,690
And that will only give us--

103
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:46,560

104
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,970
So we have k minus i omega over
the squares, and then

105
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,590
again, Euler formula that we saw
in a previous recitation.

106
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,300
So x from this expression
is just a real

107
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,650
part of all of this.

108
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,900
So it's going to be this term.

109
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,950

110
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:14,090
Let me factorize for a moment
here, and then the result of

111
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,840
multiplying the two complex
parts as well,

112
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,090
either i minus 1.

113
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:23,060

114
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:30,540
And so that answers part
a of the problem.

115
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,390
So if we look at part b--

116
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,620
I'm just going to do it here--

117
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,030
part b we're asked to
do to solve a very,

118
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,280
very similar equation.

119
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,220

120
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,720
And I'm just going to leave
the f out for now.

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,400
It's basically the same
equation, except that the

122
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,250
input now is a sine instead
of a cosine.

123
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,770
So we can use the same trick as
we used for question a by

124
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,200
realizing that now the sine is
just an imaginary part of the

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:13,940
exponential, the complex
exponential.

126
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,080
So we don't need to
redo all the work.

127
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,050
We only need to, if we were
considering this equation, to

128
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,620
just take the imaginary part of
the solution that we just

129
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,920
found here.

130
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,850
And we can just read off the
solution from this line.

131
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,950

132
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,429
Note that in this expression,
I left out the homogeneous

133
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:40,520
part, which I should
add here from here.

134
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,330
And this was just
a complex part.

135
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,320
So to come back to what I was
saying, the sine is just the

136
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,350
imaginary part of the
complex exponential.

137
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,920
So we're just going to write
down the solution

138
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
by reading off here.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,980
So again, we have the
homogeneous part, which would

140
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,590
be another real valued constant,
and then the real

141
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:10,320
part of this expression,
1 over k

142
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,620
squared plus omega squared.

143
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:21,880
And it's imaginary part then
would give us a k sine omega t

144
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:32,010
and a minus omega cos omega t.

145
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,800
So this would be the solution
for part b,

146
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,000
if we had this equation.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,460
But we actually have an equation
with an additional

148
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,990
amplitude F. And what this
leads to do is just an

149
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,820
additional constant that would
appear then for this solution.

150
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,640
And we could see that if we
rewound the way we solved in

151
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,580
part a, and saw that introducing
constant F to the

152
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,130
equation is equivalent to just
multiplying the full equation

153
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,190
with F. And then in the
integrating factor part, we

154
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,660
would end up with an F in front
of our solution when we

155
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,990
are doing the integration.

156
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,190
And so basically, that amplitude
could be absorbed in

157
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,300
the constant of integration
for the homogeneous part.

158
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,310
And the F just remains in the
particular solution here.

159
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,180

160
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:31,260
So for the last part of the
problem, we were now asked to

161
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,600
use the superposition principle
to combine solutions

162
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:45,400
of two previous ODEs that
we could split from this

163
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:54,740
equation, cosine omega t
plus 3 sine omega t.

164
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,980
So you saw from previous
recitations that superposition

165
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,990
principle applies for
linear equations.

166
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,900
This is clearly a
linear equation.

167
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,660
And here on the right-hand
side, we have

168
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,400
two sinusoidal functions.

169
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Because it's linear we can look
at this by splitting it

170
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,400
into two equations.

171
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,900
And I'm just introducing x1, x2
as notation to distinguish

172
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,150
between the two.

173
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:26,250

174
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,290
And here we can recognize that
we already did this work that

175
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,850
was in part a, and we already
did this work in part b, where

176
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,770
F now has a value of 3.

177
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,980
And so what this is telling
us, because it's a linear

178
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,460
equation, we can use
superposition principle, the

179
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:52,550
solution, if you were to do
the addition of these two

180
00:11:52,550 --> 00:12:01,520
equations, would just be the sum
of the previous solutions

181
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,620
that we found.

182
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:09,670
So this would be our x3, if I
had labeled this with a 3.

183
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,010
And so basically, the solution
is simply the sum of the two

184
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,970
previous forms. And so we would
end up still with our c

185
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,320
minus kt, which is this
basically the homogeneous part

186
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,630
that we obtained in
the two previous

187
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,950
parts, which is common.

188
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:29,390
And then we just need to add
each particular solution

189
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,590
introduced in part
a and part b.

190
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,755
So if I have room I will
write it all out.

191
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:39,870

192
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:47,990
So we would have k cos omega t
plus omega sine, omega t from

193
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,760
the first part of the cosine.

194
00:12:50,760 --> 00:13:05,200
And then we're introducing a 3k
sine omega t minus 3 omega

195
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,450
cosine omega t.

196
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:12,490

197
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,990
And that would be then
the solution of the

198
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,860
combined two equations.

199
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,530
And so you don't need to redo
the full work by using the

200
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,000
superposition principle.

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,420
So here the key was just to
recognize that the cosines and

202
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,040
the sines are basically real
parts and imaginary parts of

203
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,520
the complex number, of the
exponential of i omega t.

204
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,580
Again, it's just
Euler formula.

205
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,550
And using that as a shortcut to
be able to kill two birds

206
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,200
with one stone and solve the
two equations by using only

207
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,020
one approach, which is just
the integrating factor.

208
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,680
And this ends the session
for today.

209
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,930
