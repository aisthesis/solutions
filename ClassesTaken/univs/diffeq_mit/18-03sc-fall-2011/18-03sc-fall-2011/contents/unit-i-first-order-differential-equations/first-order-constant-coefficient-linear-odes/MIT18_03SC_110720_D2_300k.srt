00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,796

2
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:06,970
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,790
Welcome back.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,350
So today, we're going to take
a look at first-order linear

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,340
differential equations with
constant coefficients.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,540
And specifically, we're going to
use integrating factors to

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,220
solve them.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,840
So the equation that we're going
to solve today is x dot

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,480
plus kx equals 1.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,830
And then in part B we're going
to change the right-hand side

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,240
to e to the minus 5t.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,040
And then in part C, we're asked
to use the superposition

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,850
principle to solve x dot plus
kx equals 4 plus 7e

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,190
to the minus 5t.

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,500
So I'll let you think about this
for a moment, and I'll

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,750
come back in a second.

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:56,415

18
00:00:56,415 --> 00:00:57,490
Hi, everyone.

19
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,810
Welcome back.

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,990
So I should mention that every
first-order linear

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,350
differential equation, whether
it has constant coefficients

22
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,650
or not, can always be solved
using an integrating factor.

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,010
However, in this case, we have
a constant coefficient, which

24
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,490
is particularly nice.

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,570
And later on in the course,
we're going to learn some even

26
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,200
better ways, or quicker ways,
to solve linear differential

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,370
equations with constant
coefficients.

28
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,520
But for today, we're asked to
use an integrating factor.

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,330

30
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,430
So for part A, we have
the equation x dot

31
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,390
plus kx equals 1.

32
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,600
And the first step
is to compute

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,970
the integrating factor.

34
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,200
So the integrating factor, which
I'll call g of t, it's

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,280
always going to be an
exponential of the integral of

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,130
the function that appears
in front of x.

37
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,720

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,200
So in this case, the function
is just a constant.

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,450
It's k.

40
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,360

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,860
So we have kdt, which gives
us e to the kt.

42
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,640

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,320
So once we have the integrating
factor, we just

44
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,000
multiply our equation
through by g of t.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:38,910

46
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:45,160
And by construction, what the
integrating factor does is it

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,000
lets us combine these two terms
on the left-hand side

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,250
into an exact derivative.

49
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,840

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,210
So these two terms are actually
the time derivative

51
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:03,160
of the product x times
the integrating

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,755
factor e to the kt.

53
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:08,390

54
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,060
And then on the right-hand side
we just have e to the kt.

55
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,520
So we can just go ahead
and integrate both

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,770
sides of the equation.

57
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:22,100

58
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,760
And when we do that, the
right-hand side becomes the

59
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:34,600
integral kt, which is 1 over k e
to the kt plus a constant of

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,850
integration.

61
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,530

62
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,650
And now, just to isolate
x, I could divide

63
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,900
through by e to the kt.

64
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,860

65
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:57,070
And I obtain 1 over k plus a
constant e to the minus kt.

66
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,810

67
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,770
So here's the solution
to the ODE.

68
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,620
OK, so this concludes part A.

69
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:19,380
For part B, we have the equation
x dot plus kx equals

70
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,000
e to the negative 5t.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,540
So if we take a look at this
equation, the only thing that

72
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,330
we've changed is the
right-hand side.

73
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,840
We haven't changed the
left-hand side.

74
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,080

75
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,720
And again, if we compute the
integrating factor, well, we

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,790
know that it's the same
integrating factor as in part

77
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,740
A. And the reason is that the
integrating factor only

78
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,020
depends on the left-hand side.

79
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:50,640
It only depends on the linear
terms. So I can multiply the

80
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,660
equation through by the
integrating factor again.

81
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:00,110

82
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,990
And when I do this, I'll just
combine the terms on the

83
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,260
right-hand side.

84
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,385
So this is e to the kt times
e to the minus 5t.

85
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:14,780

86
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,580
And again, by construction, the
left-hand side is going to

87
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,320
be the same as in part A,
the time derivative of

88
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,570
x times e to kt.

89
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:34,920

90
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,655
And now we can go ahead and
integrate both sides.

91
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:51,680

92
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,160
OK, so if we integrate this,
we end up getting 1 over k

93
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:02,870
minus 5, e to the k minus
5t, plus a constant c.

94
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,310

95
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,050
And if we step back and take a
look at this for a second, we

96
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,290
see that when k equals
5, we have a problem.

97
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,560
Particularly, the denominator
vanishes, which would

98
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,560
give us 1 over 0.

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,820
So this equation, this
right-hand side, actually only

100
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,030
holds when k is not
equal to 5.

101
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,380
So this is only valid for
k not equal to five.

102
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,960

103
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,270
So the question is, what happens
when k equals to five?

104
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:45,180

105
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:53,460
And in this case, we would have
x, e to the kt, times the

106
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,360
integral of 1dt, which
would just give us t

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,610
plus a constant c.

108
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:08,070

109
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:15,770
So in this case, we would have
t, e to the minus kt, plus c,

110
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,950
e to the minus kt.

111
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,540
And this is when k
is equal to 5.

112
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,870

113
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:31,450
Meanwhile, for k not equal to 5,
well, we have the solution

114
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,720
worked out already.

115
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,055
So we can just isolate x, and
divide through by e to the kt.

116
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:44,660

117
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:52,950
And we have 1 over k minus 5,
e to the minus 5t, plus c, e

118
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,200
to the minus kt.

119
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:02,570

120
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,310
And this concludes part B.

121
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:11,580
So the solution for k equal to
5 is t, e to the minus kt,

122
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,670
which would be e to the minus
5t, plus a constant c times e

123
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,560
to the minus 5t.

124
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,990
And when k is not equal to 5, we
have 1 over k minus 5, e to

125
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,720
the minus 5t, plus c,
e to the minus kt.

126
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,650
So I'd just like to point out
a few things between the

127
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,940
solutions for part A and for
part B. First off, we note

128
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,299
that both part A and part B
share a common solution of the

129
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,539
form constant c times
e to the minus kt.

130
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,590
So this is a term that appears
in the solution for both part

131
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,490
A and for part B. The reason is
this can be thought of as

132
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,890
the homogeneous solution to
the differential equation.

133
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,400
This is the term that solves the
differential equation when

134
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,860
the right-hand side
is set to 0.

135
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,930

136
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:06,610
Secondly, in part B, if we take
a look, when k is not

137
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,740
equal to 5, we have the term,
which is a constant, times e

138
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,560
to the minus 5t.

139
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:23,790
However, when we have k equal to
5, what happens is we have

140
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,430
a term which essentially
occurs from forcing the

141
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,520
differential equation on
resonance, which gives us an

142
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,070
extra factor of t times
e to the minus 5t.

143
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,450
And we'll see more about
resonance in the future.

144
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,035
OK, so for part c, we're asked
to use superposition.

145
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:50,900

146
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,500
To solve the differential
equation x dot plus kx equals

147
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,615
4 plus 7e to the minus 5t.

148
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:04,420

149
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,670
Now if we take a look at this
differential equation, we

150
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,820
already know the solution when
the right-hand side is 1 and

151
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,360
when the right-hand side
is e to the minus 5t.

152
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,800
So we've changed the right-hand
side now so it's 4

153
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,490
times 1 plus 7 times
e to the minus 5t.

154
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,700
So what's the total solution
going to be?

155
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,310
Well, it's going to be four
times our solution when the

156
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,310
right-hand side was 1, plus
seven times the solution when

157
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,725
the right-hand side was
e to the minus 5t.

158
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:36,430
This is one of the beautiful
things about linear equations.

159
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,340
When we add two forcings to the
right-hand side, our total

160
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,970
solution is just going to be
the sum of the solutions to

161
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,100
the

162
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,520
individual terms. OK.

163
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,540
So what this means is our
solution, x, is going to be 4

164
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,010
times the solution when the
right-hand side was 1.

165
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:05,910
And in that case, it was 1 over
k plus c, e to the minus

166
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:16,230
kt, plus 7 times the solution
when the right-hand side was e

167
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,100
to the minus 5t.

168
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,940
And when k was not equal to 5,
this becomes 1 over k minus 5,

169
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,700
e to the minus 5t, plus
c, e to the minus kt.

170
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,550

171
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,860
So if we take a look at the sum
of these two terms, I'll

172
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,330
denote the two constants
as c1 and c2.

173
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,480
We actually have 4 times
c1 plus 7 times c2.

174
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,920
That's just going to give
us a new constant, c3.

175
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:58,861
So in general, this becomes 4
over k plus 1 over k minus 5,

176
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:10,760
e to the minus 5t, plus a
constant c, e to the minus kt.

177
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,970
So I can just recombine the 4,
c, e to the minus kt, and the

178
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,620
7, c, e to the minus kt.

179
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,762
That together just gives me a
new constant, c3, times e to

180
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:22,670
the minus kt.

181
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,790
And this is the solution when
k is not equal to 5.

182
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,280
When k equals to 5, what we do
is we just replace this term

183
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,720
with t, e to the minus kt.

184
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,285
So this is when k is
not equal to 5.

185
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:43,350

186
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,350
It should be a 7 here.

187
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,640

188
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,270
So I'll just conclude there.

189
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,680
And for summary, we've taken a
look at a first-order linear

190
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,850
differential equation
with a couple

191
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,550
different right-hand sides.

192
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,640
We've solved them using
an integrating factor.

193
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,680
And then what we've done is
we've used the superposition

194
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,520
principle to solve the same
ODE for a right-hand side,

195
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,010
which is the superposition of
multiples of the functions

196
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,770
that we've had in part A and
for part B. So I'd like to

197
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,690
conclude here, and I'll
see you next time.

198
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,940
