00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,792

2
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:03,920
PROFESSOR: I want to use this
applet, Amplitude And Phase,

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,450
First Order, to show you some
of the functionalities that

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,790
are common to the
MIT mathlets.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,110
First of all, if your browser
window looks like this, so

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:21,370
that the label at the top is
too large, or like this, so

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,540
that it's missing some of the
window, it's because you have

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,300
the zoom on your browser
set wrong.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,910
And you can adjust it with
command, or control plus or

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,600
minus keys, so that
it looks correct.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,950
So let's see what we have
in this applet.

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,530
At the top, you can see the
differential equation that

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,340
this applet deals with.

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,900
This differential equation
models many different physical

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,850
phenomena, and the story I want
to tell you involves the

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,780
ocean, measured by this blue
level here, connected to a bay

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,310
by this channel.

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,420
And here's a measure of the
water level in the bay.

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,080
As time goes on, the level of
water in the ocean changes

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,020
because of tides, and the water
level in the bay follows

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:14,350
suit mediated by a slanting
level in the channel.

22
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,950
I'm dragging this time slider
under the graphing window, and

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,240
you can set it wherever
you want.

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,600
In fact, if you want to set it
at exactly 12, because there's

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,000
a hash mark here, I can click
on this 12, and the time

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,470
slider moves to that point.

27
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,010
Or you can return time to time
zero by this arrow key, and

28
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,920
then animate by pushing this
double right arrow key and

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,750
watch the tide move
up and down.

30
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,400

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,210
There's very carefully designed
color coding in all

32
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,650
of these applets.

33
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,040
In this case, blue represents
the ocean, and you can see

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,995
that it also represents the
curve traced out by the height

35
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:58,030
of the ocean as time
increases.

36
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,170
And yellow represents the
water level in the bay.

37
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,590
When I drag the cursor over this
graphing window, you can

38
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,009
see a crosshair forming, and
below the window, you can see

39
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,720
readout of time and the x
variable, vertical direction.

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,350
You can use this to
make measurements.

41
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,680
For example, I can see that the
tide in the bay seems to

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,470
have maximal height of 0.38.

43
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,320
In many of these applets, you
can make measurements by using

44
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,490
a rollover over the
graphing window.

45
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,970
Let's see what else we
have in this applet.

46
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,650
Down here, there's a
slider marked k.

47
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,550
This is the coupling constant.

48
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,430
It reflects the width of the
channel in the story that I'm

49
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,630
telling you.

50
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,460
When k is small, the channel is
very narrow and the ocean

51
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,800
level has very little effect on
the water level in the bay.

52
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,480
In fact, when k is equal to
zero, it has no effect at all.

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,890
On the other hand, when k
becomes larger, the water

54
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,570
level in the bay tracks
the ocean

55
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,290
water level very closely.

56
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,680
Let's set k to one, here.

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,430
And think about another
thing you can vary.

58
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:18,150
In reality, you can't change
the period of the tides.

59
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,330
Even King Canute couldn't
do that.

60
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,790
But here in this tool, we can.

61
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,520
And I can vary the circular
frequency of this tidal input

62
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,570
signal by changing the omega
slider over here on the right.

63
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,260
I can make it small, and so the
period is very long, or

64
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,910
larger and make the tides
happen faster.

65
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,840
So we can animate this again.

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,780
You can see things
happen faster.

67
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,210
The curve is tighter, and
the effect is different.

68
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,400
In fact, if we watch what
happens when I move omega from

69
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,270
one down to a smaller number,
you can see the maximum height

70
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,410
of the tide changes.

71
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,300
The amplitude of the
tide changes.

72
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,780
It depends upon omega.

73
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,740
In fact, one of the nice things
about these systems is

74
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,860
that if you have a sinusoidal
input--

75
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,200
as we do here, this
blue curve--

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,810
then the output signal is also
going to be sinusoidal and of

77
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,380
the same frequency.

78
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,089
So there's only two things we
need to know about the output

79
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,960
here, this yellow signal.

80
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,955
Namely, the amplitude and the
phase lag behind the input

81
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:30,460
signal, the blue curve.

82
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,560
And those two quantities can be
measured, can be graphed,

83
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,260
against the input frequency, and
we can see those graphs by

84
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,320
clicking on this check box
called Bode plots down here.

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,090
So this opens two new windows.

86
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:52,270
The upper one records the
amplitude as a function of the

87
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,090
angular input frequency, and
the lower one records the

88
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,460
number of degrees behind
the input frequency

89
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,480
that the bay falls.

90
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,850
So as omega changes, you can see
all these various things

91
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,080
changing simultaneously.

92
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,365
This is a characteristic feature
of these applets.

93
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:17,090
The same information is recorded
in several different

94
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:24,990
places and always connected
visually by placement.

95
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,970
So you can see the amplitude
is 0.71 here.

96
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,900
This yellow horizontal line
connects it with the maxima of

97
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,060
the output curve.

98
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,870
And also by color.

99
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,370
What else do we see here?

100
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,620
There's a red line segment here
on this curve, which I

101
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,770
can make a little bit bigger if
I decrease the k a bit and

102
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,630
decrease the frequency
a little bit.

103
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,590
What is this red curve here,
this red line here?

104
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,830
Well, it connects to this
vertical strut which goes up

105
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,500
to the maximum of the
output curve.

106
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,390
And it begins at the maximum
of the input curve.

107
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,780
In other words, it's the amount
of time that the output

108
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,590
falls behind the input.

109
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,880
It's the time lag, and that
time lag is recorded

110
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,800
numerically down here.

111
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,270
It's 1.96 in this example.

112
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,070
There's one more check
box to explore called

113
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,330
Nyquist plot here.

114
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,950
Let's click it and
see what happens.

115
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,510

116
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,360
This opens a window at the
bottom here which records a

117
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,090
complex number.

118
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:45,310
That complex number contains
a magnitude and an angle.

119
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,870
And the magnitude is the
amplitude of the system

120
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,260
response, and the angle
represents the phase lag of

121
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,200
the system response.

122
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,900
You can see these things
changing together when I move

123
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,620
the omega slider here.

124
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,800
Watch both the windows above
the slider and the window

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,640
below the slider, and you can
see that they change together.

126
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,410
This bottom representation
is a complex number.

127
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,570
It's very useful in
understanding the relationship

128
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,750
between phase lag and amplitude,
and it also

129
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,790
represents the way we solve
these differential equations

130
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,070
in the Differential Equations
course at MIT.

131
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,950
This is just a beginning and
indication of some of the

132
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,170
functionalities of these
MIT mathlets.

133
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,640
If you want to see a list of
them that are associated any

134
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,410
one of the applets, there's
always a Help key in the upper

135
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,460
right hand corner which will
open a page that simply

136
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,990
describes the functionalities
present in

137
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,180
that particular applet.

138
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,660
So have fun with these.

139
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,910
You can play around with them.

140
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,060
You can't break anything
by clicking buttons and

141
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,770
experimenting with rollovers
and moving the sliders.

142
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:05,019
