00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,126

2
00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:06,720
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,850
Welcome back.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,670
So today, I'd like to tackle
a problem in numerical

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,310
integration of ODEs

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,490
specifically on Euler's method.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,010
And the problem we're interested
in considering

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,670
today is the ODE y prime equals
y squared minus xy.

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,850
And we're interested in
integrating the solution that

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,400
starts at y of zero is equal
to negative 1 using a step

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
size of 0.5.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,880
And we want to integrate
it to y of 1.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,210
And then for the second part,
we're interested in if our

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,240
first step of integration
either overestimates or

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,560
underestimates the
exact solution.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,240
So I'll let you think about
this and work it out for

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,950
yourself, and I'll come
back in a moment.

18
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:57,990

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,990
Hi everyone.

20
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,400
Welcome back.

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,470
So as I mentioned before, this
is a problem in numerics.

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,870
And specifically, whenever
you're given an ODE, you can

23
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,830
almost always numerically
integrate it on a computer.

24
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,240
And this is quite possibly the
simplest algorithm for

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,590
numerical integration.

26
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,720
So specifically, what we do is
we take the left-hand side,

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,410
the derivative, y prime, and we
approximate it using a very

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,090
simple finite difference
formula.

29
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,450

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,190
So if I take y prime and
approximate it as y of n plus

31
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:39,710
1 minus y of n divided by h,
where h is the step size, then

32
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:45,360
I can approximate the continuous
ODE using this

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,600
simple formula.

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,250
So here h as I mentioned
is the step size.

35
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,150

36
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:05,030
F in this case is the right-hand
side of the ODE And

37
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,660
we see that y of n plus 1 minus
y of n divided by h is

38
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,910
an approximation to y prime.

39
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,730

40
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,490
In addition, we can also write
down x of n plus 1 is just

41
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,386
equal to x of n plus h.

42
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:23,570

43
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,950
And I'm using subscripts n here
just to denote the step

44
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,670
of the algorithm.

45
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,900
So for part A, we're asked to
integrate the solution.

46
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,550
It starts at y of zero is equal
to negative 1 to y of 1.

47
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,750
So what this means for part A
is we want x of zero to be

48
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,790
zero, and we want y of zero
to be negative 1.

49
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,890

50
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,870
Now to further integrate this
equation, the quickest way to

51
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,710
do it, especially if you're
in a test scenario,

52
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,960
is to build a table.

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,410

54
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,870
So a nice table to build is
one that has a column n,

55
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,240
x of n, y of n.

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,550
I'm going to write f of n.

57
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,170

58
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,810
F of n is to denote
f evaluated at x

59
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,060
of n and y of n.

60
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,650

61
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,050
And then, it's also useful to
write down h times f of n

62
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,720
because the quantity h times f
of n comes up in the addition

63
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,756
of y of n plus 1 is equal to
y of n plus h times f of n.

64
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:43,420

65
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,540
And in the problem under
consideration, I'm just going

66
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,200
to fill in the first two columns
because they're the

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,420
easiest. We have n is equal
to zero, 1 and 2.

68
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,540
X of n is starting
off at zero.

69
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,110
So x of zero is zero.

70
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,370
X of 1 is going to be 0.5.

71
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,160
And then, x of 2
is equal to 1.

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,820
In addition, we're also told
that y of zero is equal to

73
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,900
negative 1.

74
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:19,990
And now for f of n, I'll just
use the side here, what's f of

75
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,240
zero going to be?

76
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,710
Well, it's going to be
y of zero minus x

77
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,160
of zero y of zero.

78
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,370

79
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,760
So this gives us 1 and zero.

80
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,000
So we can fill in a 0.1 here,
which means that h times f of

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,050
1 is going to be 0.5.

82
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,950

83
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:52,540
And now with h of f of n,
we can fill in y of 1.

84
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,690
So y of 1 is just going to
be y of zero plus 0.5.

85
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,820
And y of zero is negative 1.

86
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,710
So this is going to
be negative 0.5.

87
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,250

88
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,810
Now, we need to fill
in f of 1.

89
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:16,450
So this is going to be y of 1
squared minus x of 1 y of 1.

90
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,180
Now y of 1 squared, this is
negative 0.5 squared.

91
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,330

92
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,860
X of 1 is 0.5.

93
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,670
And y of 1 is again,
negative 0.5.

94
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,840

95
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,440
So this gives us one quarter
plus one quarter, which

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,690
together is just 0.5.

97
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,310

98
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,310
So we have 0.5 in
this square now.

99
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:53,430
And then h times 0.5 is 0.5
squared, which is just 0.25.

100
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,870
Now y of 2 is just going to be
y of 1 plus h times f of 1.

101
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,720
So we know h of f of 1 is
0.25, and y of 1 is just

102
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,100
negative 0.5.

103
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:12,380
So this is going to
be negative 0.25.

104
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,160
And we note that this is the
answer we're looking for.

105
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,510
So just to conclude our
approximation y of 2, which is

106
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:30,090
approximately y evaluated
at 1, is going

107
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:36,990
to be negative 0.25.

108
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,950
So for part B, we're asked
does our approximation

109
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,490
negative 0.25 overestimate or
underestimate the actual exact

110
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,710
solution of the ODE?

111
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,090
Now, in general, what you want
to do is you want to take the

112
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,140
second derivative.

113
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,900
However, for this problem, we're
only going to consider

114
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,770
the first step.

115
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,970
So our first step, does it
overestimate or underestimate

116
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,750
the exact solution?

117
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,980
And to do this, what we want
to do is we want to take a

118
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,570
look at the concavity.

119
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,230
So we want to look at
y double prime.

120
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:13,260
So y double prime is going
to be d by dx of y prime.

121
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,240
And we know from the ODE y prime
is y squared minus xy.

122
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,140
So I can work this out to be
2y y prime, just using the

123
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:32,010
chain rule, minus y
minus xy prime.

124
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,710
And at the first step, we're
interested in evaluating this

125
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,440
quantity at the point
x equals zero, y is

126
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,660
equal to negative 1.

127
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,910
So this is the first step.

128
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,410

129
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,650
So at x is equal to zero, y is
equal to negative 1, this

130
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:56,500
simplifies to minus
2y prime plus 1.

131
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,580
This term right here
drops off.

132
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,930
And y prime specifically
is going to be y

133
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,910
squared minus xy.

134
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,540
So we get 2.

135
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,370
Y squared is going to be
1 minus zero plus 1.

136
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,900
So together, this is going
to give us minus 1.

137
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,370
And we note that this
is less than zero.

138
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,490

139
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,400
So we've just shown that the
concavity at our starting

140
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,120
point, x equals zero, y
is equal to negative 1

141
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,880
is less than zero.

142
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,780
So what this means is that our
initial approximation is going

143
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,390
to overestimate the solution.

144
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,480
We can see that it's going to
overestimate it just by a

145
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,730
quick sketch.

146
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,909

147
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:46,770
For example, if I were to plot y
and x, we're starting off at

148
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,820
this point, x is equal
to zero, y is

149
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,330
equal to negative 1.

150
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,360
So this is y zero is equal
to negative 1.

151
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,490
We know the exact solutions
increasing, and it's concave

152
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,170
down because the second
derivative is negative 1.

153
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,510
And by Euler's formula, what
we're doing is we're

154
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,970
approximating the solution
using a tangent

155
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,790
line at this point.

156
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,600
So we can see that our
approximate solution when we

157
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,310
take one step to go from here to
here, so this is x of zero,

158
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,293
this is x of 1, our solution
which is now going to be y of

159
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:31,320
1 here is going to overestimate
the curve.

160
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,230
And the reason it overestimates
it, I'll just

161
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,930
reiterate again is because our
solution is concave down.

162
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,090
So this concludes the problem.

163
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,640
And just to reiterate, when
dealing with Euler's method,

164
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,160
the best thing to do is just
to build a table like this.

165
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,530
And you can quickly
work it out.

166
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:54,400
Secondly, if you're asked
questions on if your numerical

167
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,830
solution overestimates or
underestimates the exact

168
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,950
solution, typically what you
want to do is you want to look

169
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,880
at the concavity.

170
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,890
And then, you can always just
sketch a quick diagram on the

171
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:09,470
back of a notepad to see if the
solution overestimates or

172
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,570
underestimates the
exact solution.

173
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,860
