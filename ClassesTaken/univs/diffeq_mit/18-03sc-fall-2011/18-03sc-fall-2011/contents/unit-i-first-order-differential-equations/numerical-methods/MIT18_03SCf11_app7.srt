1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,180
The Euler's method applet helps
us understand numerical

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,350
methods for approximating
solutions to

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,360
differential equations.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,170
I can choose the differential
equation using this pull down

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,050
menu, and I've selected the
equation y prime equals y

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,720
squared minus x, the same
equation that we used in the

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,130
isocline applet.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,090
The graphing window shows a
slope field, the slope field

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,190
of this equation.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,830
And the value of the slope
field can be read off by

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,380
rolling over the window.

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,800
It's read off on the right hand
side here. f of xy is

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,830
various values depending
on where I'm located.

15
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,280
I've also chosen an initial
condition, initial value, of x

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,220
equals x, zero is zero,
and y zero is minus 1.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,840
I can see the actual solution
with that initial condition by

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,520
pressing Actual from this set
of boxes and checking Start.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,450
Now a curve is drawing on
the graphing plane.

20
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,050
This is the solution with
that initial condition.

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,820
And a table of values shows
up in this left table.

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,480

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,760
We can see that this is one of
the solutions which is sucked

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,790
into the funnel.

25
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,200
So we understand the values
of y of x quite

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,330
well when x is large.

27
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,240
But what if I want to know
the value of y of 1?

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,010
According to the table over
here, the value is

29
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,100
approximately minus 0.83.

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,340
But how do we know that?

31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,740
Euler's method is the simplest
numerical method.

32
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,030
It uses the tangent line
approximation.

33
00:01:49,030 --> 00:02:00,360
If I set the step size to be 1,
I can then click Start, and

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,030
this will draw a tangent line
segment with delta x equal to

35
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,380
1 starting at my initial
condition, and with slope

36
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,020
given by the slope field
at that point.

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:17,400
So the tangent line
approximation to y of 1 is the

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,200
value zero.

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,820
Well, that's not very good.

40
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,060
But I can improve things by
using a smaller step size.

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,480
So let's go down to a step
size of 1/4, start again.

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,140
Now I've drawn a tangent line
segment, but the horizontal

43
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,410
distance is only 1/4.

44
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,850

45
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,460
Let's see what if we can see
this more clearly by pressing

46
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,130
the zoom key.

47
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,630
This will zoom in on the same
picture that we had before.

48
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,560

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,560
I can measure the slope field at
the end point of this green

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,700
line segment.

51
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,540
It seems to be about 0.32.

52
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,950
And by pressing Next Step, I can
draw a line segment moving

53
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,810
off with that slope.

54
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,200
So this now, it produces a
polygon, the Euler polygon,

55
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,710
which will stay closer to the
actual curve than the simple

56
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,300
tangent line approximation
did.

57
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,810
I can continue this process by
continuing to say Next Step.

58
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,930
The table of values appears on
the left, and we discover that

59
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,310
the Euler approximation to y
of 1 with step size 1/4, is

60
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,560
minus 0.75.

61
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,070
Much better than the earlier
value we had.

62
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,360
And I can improve things still
further by choosing a

63
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,660
smaller step size.

64
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,690
In fact, you get as close as
you want to the actual

65
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,430
solution by selecting
sufficiently small step sizes.

66
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,730
Let's do one more example
with step size of 1/8.

67
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,780
Now I will click 8 times to
produce an Euler polygon with

68
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,130
8 segments.

69
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,380
And I have an estimate
of minus 0.8.

70
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,550
All of these estimates
are too large.

71
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,140
All of these curves, these
polygons, lie above the actual

72
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,560
solution curve.

73
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,270
Let's see if we can
see why this is.

74
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,360

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,980
You'll notice that the slope
field is given by the formula

76
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,780
y squared minus x.

77
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,440
So as x increases, the slope
field decreases in value.

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,280
So as we're moving out along one
of these Euler struts, the

79
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,030
slope field is decreasing
under it.

80
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,530
And that causes the actual
solution to fall below the

81
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,190
Euler polygon.

82
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,405
And that process will
continue as I

83
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:51,390
iterate the Euler process.

84
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,970
So the general rule is, if the
direction field is decreasing

85
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,700
in the x direction, you should
expect the actual solution to

86
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,410
be less than the
Euler estimate.

87
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,850
There are lots of things that
can go wrong in this kind of

88
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,340
numerical work.

89
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,610
To see one of them,
let's unzoom.

90
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:16,800
Zoom back, clear the screen,
redraw the actual solution,

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,320
and choose step size 1.

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,560
Now instead of wanting to
compute y of 1, suppose that I

93
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,250
wanted to compute the value of
the solution at x equals 6.

94
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,790
Well if I try doing this
using step size of 1,

95
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,700
let's see what happens.

96
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,520
So I begin.

97
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,460
I have the same strut
I had before.

98
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,330
It's too large, but now the
slope field has a negative

99
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,020
value so that comes back down.

100
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,620
Things are looking better.

101
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,550
In the next step,
I've overshot.

102
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,110

103
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,190
And if I take another step, then
I've overshot again in

104
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,390
the other direction,
more dramatically.

105
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,980
And now the slow feels
even more negative.

106
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,830
So when I take the next step,
I've overshot yet again, more

107
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,330
dramatically.

108
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,820
And if I take the next step,
now my estimate for the

109
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,830
solution, which is down here at
x equals 6 is the value 7,

110
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,590
this is in the range where the
slope field continues to

111
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,800
increase forever.

112
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,270
And so my estimated solution
will zoom off towards

113
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,200
infinity, while the actual
curve is down here.

114
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,940
I call this catastrophic
overshoot.

115
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,550
It's just one of a number of
different things that can go

116
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,090
wrong when you try to use
these numerical methods.

117
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,340
