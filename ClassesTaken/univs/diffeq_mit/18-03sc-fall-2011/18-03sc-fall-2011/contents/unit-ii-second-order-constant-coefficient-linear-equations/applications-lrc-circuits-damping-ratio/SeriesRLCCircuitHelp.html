          parameters of a sinusoidally driven RLC circuit are controlled by sliders 
          at lower right: the resistance R, inductance L, capacitance C, maximum 
          voltage V<sub>0</sub> of the source, and circular frequency &omega;. 
          These values may be incremented using the [&lt;] and [&gt;] checkboxes, 
          as well as by grabbing the slider. The selected value is read out to 
          the right of the slider. The source voltage is given by V = V<sub>0</sub>sin(&omega;t) 
          .</strong></font></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Check 
          boxes to the left of the sliders toggle the presence of a resistor, 
          an inductance coil, and a capacitor. Further to the right are check 
          boxes which toggle the representation of the voltage drops across the 
          resistor, the coil, and the capacitor, the voltage increase across the 
          voltage source, and the current through the circuit. Each box admits 
          three settings: black, which leaves the quantity unrepresented; pale 
          gray, which causes the quantity to be represented by the same color; 
          and vivid yellow (for V<sub>R</sub>), orange (for V<sub>L</sub>), red 
          (for V<sub>C</sub>), cyan (for the source voltage), or green (for the 
          current).</font></strong></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>The 
          representation occurs in three places. At bottom left, the circuit is 
          represented. When the circuit element is removed using the checkbox, 
          its representation in the circuit diagram is removed. When the value 
          of the voltage drop or increase is requested, leads appear in the appropriate 
          location and a two headed arrow, of the appropriate color, indicates 
          the gap across which the voltage is measured.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>At 
          upper right there is a graphing window, showing the graphs of the various 
          quantities as functions of time. Below the graph is a slider which allows 
          the user to set the time. The time value is set using a slider under the window. The [&gt;&gt;] key starts an 
          animation. The [&lt;&lt;] key resets t to t = 0 . A scale of volts appears at left, and (if toggled) a scale of Amperes 
          appears at right. A cursor rollover creates a set of crosshairs and 
          a readout of the time and &quot;x&quot; (voltage, and amperage if appropriate) 
          values.</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>The 
          [Phasor diagram] key toggles display of a phasor diagram at upper left. 
          Once selected, it gives a third representation of the voltage drops 
          and the current. The vectors are absent, ghosted, or colored, according 
          to the<br>
          selections made at lower right. The vectors rotate as time increases. 
          The imaginary parts of the phasor complex numbers are the corresponding 
          values of the system functions. This relationship is indicated by ghosted 
          horizontal<br>
          lines which are toggled by the [Relate graphs] key.</strong></font></p>
