00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:06,740
DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,260
Welcome back.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,390
So today I'd like to take a look
at gain and phase lag.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,260
And we're going to consider
this simple problem.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,620
So first off, find a periodic
solution to x dot dot plus 8x

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,850
dot plus 7x equals F0 times
cosine omega t.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,040
So basically, it's just
forcing a differential

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,800
equation with some frequency
cosine omega t.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,750
And the problem we're interested
in today is to give

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,450
the gain and phase lag to
this periodic solution.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,610
So I'll let you take a look at
this problem and I'll be back

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,860
in a minute.

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:49,852

15
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,430
Hi, everyone.

16
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,880
Welcome back.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,460
OK, so we're interested in
finding this periodic solution

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,110
to the differential equation.

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,840
And we see here that we're
forcing it with right-hand

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,370
side of cosine omega t.

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,480
So the standard procedure
is to first complexify.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:14,940

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,440
So we're going to consider the
differential equation x dot

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,760
dot plus 8x dot plus 7x equals
F0 e to the i omega t.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,390

26
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,880
And then at the end, we're going
to take the real part of

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,980
our solution to this
differential equation.

28
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,810
And we do this because cosine
omega t is the real part of e

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,770
to the i omega t.

30
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,860
Now, for this equation, we see
that we're forcing it with an

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,190
exponential.

32
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,265
So we can just use the
exponential response formula.

33
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:50,520

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,790
And this gives us a particular
solution.

35
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,630
So the exponential response
formula is 1 over p of i omega

36
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,015
times the right-hand
side, which is F0 e

37
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:05,150
to the i omega t.

38
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,820
And in this case, the
characteristic polynomial, p

39
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:15,360
of s, is s squared
plus 8s plus 7.

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,360
So that p of i omega is going
to be 7 minus omega squared.

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,590
So the omega squared comes from
s squared plus 8i omega.

42
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,170

43
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,960
Now, I'd just like to
take a moment and

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,810
step back for a second.

45
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,650
If we take a look at the
differential equation, the

46
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:41,040
input on the right-hand side
is F0 e to the i omega t.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,280
Now notice how this
characteristic--

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,780
sorry, the exponential response
formula gives us a

49
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,650
particular solution, which is
1 over p of i omega F0 e to

50
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,490
the i omega t, which is
a periodic solution.

51
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:03,300
But moreover, the output of this
formula shows that it's

52
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,540
actually the input forcing
multiplied by this factor 1

53
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,300
over p of i omega.

54
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,350
So this factor right here, 1
over p of i omega relates the

55
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,290
input forcing to the
output forcing.

56
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,210
Or sorry, to the output
response.

57
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,020
And this factor is sometimes
called the complex gain.

58
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,990

59
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,570
And the reason it's the complex
gain is because if we

60
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,700
take a look at p of i omega,
it has a real part and an

61
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,680
imaginary part.

62
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:46,690
So specifically, p of i omega
contains two pieces of

63
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,940
information.

64
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:59,570

65
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,490
Because it's a complex number,
we can think of it as being an

66
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,430
amplitude in a phase.

67
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:14,500
So the amplitude of p
of i omega is It's

68
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,750
sometimes called the gain.

69
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,230

70
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:25,500
And the phase of p of i omega
is the phase lag.

71
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,210

72
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,450
So p of i omega contains two
pieces of information, which

73
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,710
relate the input forcing signal
to the output response

74
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,270
of the differential equation.

75
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,240
Now, I'd like to go ahead and
write x of t, decomplexify.

76
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,360
So we're going to take the real
part of 1 over p of i

77
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,730
omega times F0 e to
the i omega t.

78
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:59,950
So we have 7 minus omega
squared plus 8 i omega.

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,630
Upstairs is F0 e to
the i omega t.

80
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,110

81
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,670
And I'm going to just put this
in amplitude phase form.

82
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,570

83
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:23,651
And when I take the real part,
I'll do it in two steps first.

84
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:26,910
8 omega squared.

85
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,160
Square rooted.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,980

87
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,220
F0 e to i omega t divided
by e to the i phi.

88
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,310

89
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:54,160
Where here phi is the phase lag
and tangent phi is going

90
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,125
to be the imaginary part
over the real part.

91
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:03,610

92
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:10,180
And just quickly note that as
omega goes from 0 to infinity,

93
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,640
tangent phi will go
from 0 to pi.

94
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:21,710

95
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,660
So this is the range of phi
that we're interested in.

96
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:36,820
And now, when we take the real
part, we end up with F0 1 over

97
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:44,170
7 minus omega squared quantity
squared plus 8 omega squared,

98
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,220
all squared rooted.

99
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,890
Cosine omega t minus phi.

100
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,430

101
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,800
And now we'd like to look at
what the amplitude and phase

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,350
are as a function of omega.

103
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,215
So for each fixed omega, the
output is going to be a

104
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,280
sinusoid which oscillates
at the same

105
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,850
frequency as the input.

106
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,660
However, the only difference is
that it's going to have a

107
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,180
rescaled amplitude.

108
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,420
And it will have a shifted
phase as well.

109
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:23,230
So for the amplitude response,
we're interested in plotting 1

110
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,710
over the amplitude
of p of i omega.

111
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,960
So here's the amplitude.

112
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,690

113
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,610
And this function is just
going to decrease and

114
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,120
asymptotically approach
infinity.

115
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,260
So this is the amplitude
response.

116
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,250
This is 1 over 7 minus omega
squared square rooted equals 8

117
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,264
omega squared, quantity
square rooted.

118
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,840
This is omega.

119
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,080

120
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,180
And then in addition to the
amplitude response, we also

121
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,430
have the phase.

122
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,300

123
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,720
And the phase, if I go back up
here for a second, we can

124
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:18,370
write it explicitly as phi is
equal to tan inverse 8 omega

125
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,210
divided by 7 minus
omega squared.

126
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,150

127
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,490
So I'm going to plot
omega on this axis

128
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,170
and phi on this axis.

129
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:34,190
And, OK, so to plot this curve,
we note that when omega

130
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,570
is 0, tan inverse of 0 is 0.

131
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,820
So we're going to start at 0.

132
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,640

133
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,420
Typically, what I usually like
to do in this case is look at

134
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,060
the denominator in
the arctangent.

135
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,850
We see that when omega is equal
to the square root of 7,

136
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,950
this argument blows up.

137
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,590
It goes to infinity.

138
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,170
And the arctangent of infinity
is pi over 2.

139
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,770
So I can draw a curve in here,
which is pi over 2.

140
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,880

141
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,560
So we know that phi is pi
over 2 when omega is

142
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,240
equal to root 7.

143
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,530
And note how this is the natural
frequency if there was

144
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,790
no damping in the system.

145
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,910

146
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,130
And then lastly, there's another
curve here at pi.

147
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,600
We see that as omega approaches
infinity, again,

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,125
this argument approaches 0.

149
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,850

150
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,750
And if you were to take the
derivative of this whole

151
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,480
quantity, we would
see that it's--

152
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,980
of tan inverse of this argument,
we would see that

153
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,000
the function's increasing
for all omega.

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,910
So it actually looks something
like this.

155
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,690
It looks like an s-shaped curve
that asymptotically

156
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,440
approaches pi as omega
goes to infinity.

157
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,240
So just to quickly recap.

158
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,230
When we look at the differential
equation, or a

159
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,320
particular solution to a
differential equation which is

160
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,310
being forced by a periodic
sinusoidal function, the

161
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,670
output is always going to be
rescaled and phase shifted,

162
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,160
but still oscillating at
the same frequency.

163
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,150
And specifically, depending
on which frequency the

164
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,390
differential equation's forced
at, the amplitude will take on

165
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,135
different values.

166
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:29,140
The amplitude response will
take on different values.

167
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,450
And the phase shift will also
have different values

168
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,440
depending on the frequency
of forcing.

169
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,200
So I'd just like to conclude
here, and I'll

170
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,450
see you next time.

171
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,360
