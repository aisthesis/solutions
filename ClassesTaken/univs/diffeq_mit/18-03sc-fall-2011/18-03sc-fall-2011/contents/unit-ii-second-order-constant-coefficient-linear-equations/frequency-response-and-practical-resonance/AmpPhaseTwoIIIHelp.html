        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>At 
          left a spring/mass/dashpot system is shown, driven by a piston at the 
          top.</strong></font></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          equation governing this system is displayed in yellow at the top. Mass 
          is set to 1; b is the damping constant, k is the spring constant, and 
          &omega; is the circular frequency of the sinusoidal motion of the piston.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
          the right, the position of the plunger (the input signal cos(&omega;t)) 
          is graphed in cyan, and the position of the mass (the system response 
          x ) is graphed in yellow. Diamonds indicate the current values cos(&omega;t) 
          and of x, and a vertical white line between them indicates the extension 
          of the spring. A grey vertical line measured by a red segment indicates 
          the time lag t<sub>0</sub> (which is also read out in red at the bottom 
          of the screen, below a readout of the period P in cyan).</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Rolling 
          the cursor over the graphing window produces crosshairs and a readout 
          of the values of t and x.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The time value is set using a slider under the window. The [&gt;&gt;] key starts an 
        animation. The [&lt;&lt;] key resets t to <br>
        t = 0.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Grab 
          the [b], [k], or [&omega;] slider to vary those parameters.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          [Bode plots] key toggles display of two windows on the right side of 
          the screen. The top window displays the amplitude A of the sinusodial 
          response as a function of &omega;. The window below it displays the 
          negative of the phase lag &phi; as a function of &omega;.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          [Nyquist plot] key toggles display of a window at lower right, showing 
          a portion of the complex plane. On it, a grey curve traces the path 
          traversed by the complex gain (k+ bi&omega;) / p(i&omega;) (where p(s) 
          = s<sup>2</sup> + bs + k is the characteristic polynomial) as &omega; 
          varies over positive values. A yellow diamond marks the value of this 
          complex number for the chosen value of &omega;. A yellow line segment 
          connects it to the origin. The length of this segment is the amplitude 
          A, and the angle up from the positive real axis, marked by a a green 
          arc, is -&phi;.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Roll 
          the cursor over the amplitude window to cause a horiziontal yellow line 
          to appear relating the amplitudes in the three top windows, along with 
          a readout of the amplitude. Roll the cursor over the phase shift window 
          to cause a readout of the phase shift.</font></strong></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Note: 
          These are not quite truly Bode or Nyquist plots. A Bode plot graphs 
          log(A) vs log(&omega;) or -&phi; vs log(&omega;). A Nyquist plot displays 
          k/p(i &omega;) as omega ranges from -&infin; to +&infin; it has a portion 
          above the real axis which is symmetric with what is drawn.</strong></font></p>
