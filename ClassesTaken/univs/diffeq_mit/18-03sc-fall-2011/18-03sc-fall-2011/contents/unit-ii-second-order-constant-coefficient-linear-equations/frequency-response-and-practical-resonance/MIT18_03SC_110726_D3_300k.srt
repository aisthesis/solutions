1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,772

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,810
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,340
So today, I'd like to talk
about frequency response.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,110
And specifically, we're going
to take a look at a couple

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,149
different differential
equations.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,910
And we're asked to graph
the amplitude

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,740
response for each equation.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,010
And you'll note that these
equations a, b and c have

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,400
varying amounts of damping.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,790
So for part a we're asked to
plot the amplitude response

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,760
for x dot dot plus 4x equals
f knot cosine omega t.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,100
For part b it's the same
equation, however we have an x

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,820
dot term added.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,520
For part c, again we've
increase the damping.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,920
So now we have 6x dot.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,690
And then lastly for part d,
we'd like to discuss the

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,640
resonance for each system.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,340
So I'll let you work out
this problem, and I'll

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,590
be back in a moment.

20
00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:05,962

21
00:01:05,962 --> 00:01:07,110
Hi everyone.

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,880
Welcome back.

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,500
So for part a, we're asked to
graph the amplitude response

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,450
to the differential equation x
dot dot plus 4x equals f not

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,700
cosine omega t.

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,070

27
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,050
And from a previous recitation,
we already wrote

28
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,540
down the particular response to
this differential equation.

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,520
So I'm just going to write down
the particular response,

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,030
which has the form f not
4 minus omega squared

31
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,280
cosine omega t.

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,980

33
00:01:48,980 --> 00:02:04,970
Now the amplitude response is
defined as a ratio, and

34
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,949
specifically it's the ratio of
the output amplitude of a

35
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,660
differential equation to the
input amplitude of a

36
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,250
differential equation.

37
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,180
So in the case at hand, we
have the output is a

38
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,720
sinusoidal function whose
amplitude is f not divided by

39
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,880
4 minus omega squared.

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,860
So it's the output divided
by the input.

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,410

42
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,660
These are both amplitudes.

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,370

44
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,070
And in our case, we have
f not divided by

45
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,290
4 minus omega squared.

46
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,140
This is the output amplitude.

47
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,670
And the input amplitude
is just f not.

48
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,680
So we see when we compute this
ratio the f0's divide out.

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,730
And at the end of the
day, we're left with

50
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,980
4 minus omega squared.

51
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,490

52
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,370
So I'm going to draw the
amplitude response now.

53
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,850

54
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,100
So we have omega.

55
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,150

56
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,590
And we see that when
omega is equal to

57
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,640
2, there's an asymptote.

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,470

59
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,780
When omega is equal
to 0, we have 1/4.

60
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:36,090

61
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,130
And specifically, we have
this tent-like function.

62
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,640
So this is the amplitude
response.

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:50,810

64
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,310
So notice how when we drive the
system with frequency two,

65
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,980
the amplitude response
goes to infinity.

66
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,500

67
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,770
As a result, we call
this frequency

68
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,020
the resonant frequency.

69
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:14,780

70
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,029
So this concludes part a.

71
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:22,400
For part b, we have a
differential equation with

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,650
damping now.

73
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:35,250

74
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,170
And to compute the particular
solution, we follow the

75
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,510
standard procedure of first
complexifying the right-hand

76
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,730
side and then using the
exponential response formula.

77
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,410

78
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,090
So I'm just going to write down
the particular solution.

79
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,740
If we follow these steps, we
find that it's the real part

80
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,690
of the right-hand side
complexified, which is f not e

81
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:05,240
to the i omega t divided by the
characteristic polynomial

82
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,490
evaluated at i omega.

83
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,550

84
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,090
And in this case, the
characteristic polynomial p of

85
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:23,440
s is s squared plus s plus 4.

86
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,044

87
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:38,430
p of i omega is then 4 minus
omega squared plus i omega.

88
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,970

89
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,860
And when we put the pieces
together, we end up with a

90
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:54,400
particular solution, which looks
like the real part of 1

91
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,800
over 4 minus omega squared plus
i omega f not upstairs e

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,050
to the i omega t.

93
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,990

94
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:13,190
So we're asked to compute the
amplitude response graph.

95
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,770
And if we take a look at this,
we see that the denominator

96
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,570
here is really just
a complex number.

97
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,430
So we can convert it into the
form of r,e to the i phi.

98
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,910

99
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,110
Now, the amplitude response is
defined as the ratio of the

100
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,950
output divided by the input.

101
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:38,440
And so the output amplitude is
going to be the magnitude of

102
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,690
this complex number.

103
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:59,210

104
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,660
So as a result, the amplitude
response is just the magnitude

105
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,170
of 1 over the characteristic
polynomial

106
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,020
evaluated at i omega.

107
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,300
This is also sometimes
referred to

108
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,490
as the complex gain.

109
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,370
Moreover, this term right here
contains two pieces of

110
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,560
information.

111
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,860
Not only does it contain the
amplitude response, but it

112
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,290
also contains the phase
information.

113
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,190
When we take the absolute value,
we're throwing out the

114
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,220
phase information, and we're
just remembering

115
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,470
the amplitude response.

116
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,190

117
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,700
So what is this amplitude
response look

118
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,220
like for this case?

119
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:48,530
Well, we have 1 over and it's
the magnitude of this complex

120
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,995
number, which is 4 minus omega
squared plus i omega.

121
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:53,590

122
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,870
So I just take the real part,
square it, add it to the

123
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,580
imaginary part squared,
and square

124
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,830
root the whole quantity.

125
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,000

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,840
Now there's a question
of how to graph this.

127
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,240
And we see that first off,
the square root's

128
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,800
an increasing function.

129
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,330
And we see that we're 1 over
an increasing function.

130
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,160
So there's a trick, which
is to just look first at

131
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,620
sketching this piece which is
under the radical sign.

132
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,560
And if you look at trying to
maximize this function--

133
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,160
so finding the critical
points--

134
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:37,059
we'd see that in this case, we
have one maximum, to 4 minus

135
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:42,150
omega squared plus
omega squared.

136
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:48,065
And this is at 1 omega equals
the square root of 7/2.

137
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:52,440

138
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,300
Sorry.

139
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,550
This is a minimum.

140
00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:00,730

141
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,480
So when I go to sketch this now,
we have omega, we have

142
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,730
the amplitude response.

143
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:13,350

144
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:19,310
Now, I'm going to draw in 2
from our previous diagram.

145
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,210
Now, the square root of 7/2
is just below 2, so

146
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,460
square root of 7/2.

147
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,950

148
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,940
So we end up with a maximum
at 7/2, and

149
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,320
then a decay to infinity.

150
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,950

151
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:46,780
And again, this is going to
be 1/4 when omega is 0.

152
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,320
So this is the peak amplitude
response.

153
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,270
So note that in this case, by
adding damping, what we've

154
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:59,500
done is we no longer have an
asymptote at omega equals 2.

155
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,930
But we now have a finite
amplitude, which occurs at

156
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,960
omega equals the square
root of 7/2.

157
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,820
So I'm just going to clean up
the board, and I'll be back

158
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,920
with part c in a second.

159
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,080
For part a, we have an amplitude
response diagram,

160
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,580
which looks like a
tent function.

161
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,740
And at 2, omega equals 2,
we have a resonance.

162
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,330
So the amplitude response
diverges.

163
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,250
Just like to point out, I made
a small error before.

164
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,080
I forgot to include
absolute values on

165
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,390
the denominator here.

166
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,280
The amplitude response function,
it's always a

167
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,420
positive quantity.

168
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,990
We always throw out any phase
information and leave that for

169
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,495
the phase in the description
of the response

170
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:48,870
of the linear system.

171
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,210
So the amplitude response
is always positive.

172
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,960
For part b, we added dampening
to the system.

173
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,240
And we see that there's actually
a peak point which is

174
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,490
at the square root of 7/2.

175
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,520

176
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,740
And the amplitude response is
bounded at this point, but it

177
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,200
achieves a maximum.

178
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,710
And then again it decays
to infinity.

179
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,550
So I'd like now to take
a look at part c.

180
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,590
And in part c, we have the
differential equation x dot

181
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:30,380
dot plus 6x dot plus 4x equals
f not cosine omega t.

182
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:39,430
And again, the amplitude
response is going to equal 1

183
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,380
over the absolute value
of p of i omega.

184
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,820
And in this case, p of i omega
is going to be 1 over--

185
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,750
Well, we still have the 4 minus
omega squared term.

186
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,670

187
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,960
Instead of x dot, we
now have 6x dot,

188
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,210
which gives us 6i omega.

189
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,990

190
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,280
And then again, we want to take
the absolute value of

191
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,020
this complex number.

192
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,530
And when we take the absolute
value, we just get the sum of

193
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:19,060
the real parts squared plus the
sum of the imaginary parts

194
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,742
squared, which in this case is
going to be 36 omega squared,

195
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,420
the whole quantity squared
rooted, and then we have 1

196
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,670
over this value.

197
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,040

198
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,840
So now if we'd like to plot this
function, we can still do

199
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,620
the same trick and try to
maximize or find the critical

200
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,300
points of the denominator
under the radical.

201
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,170
And if we did this, in this case
we would find that the

202
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,000
only critical point is when
omega is equal to 0.

203
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,320
Secondly, if we look at omega
going to infinity, we see that

204
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,730
the denominator goes
to infinity.

205
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,680
So this whole quantity
must go to 0.

206
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,880
So if I were to go back here to
the amplitude response for

207
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,350
part c, again, when omega is
equal to 0 it's going to start

208
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,600
off at 1/4.

209
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,050

210
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,110
I've just argued that
it goes to 0 as

211
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,380
omega goes to infinity.

212
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,310
And since there are no critical
points, we must

213
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,680
smoothly paste the function
between the two.

214
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,930
And in fact, it's always
decreasing.

215
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,700

216
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,470
So the amplitude response,
in this case, is just a

217
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,720
decreasing function.

218
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,370

219
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,020
So this concludes part c.

220
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,670
And now I'll take a
look at part d.

221
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,720
Discuss the resonance
for each system.

222
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,350
So in part a, we
had no damping.

223
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,500
And we saw that there was a
resonance at omega equals 2.

224
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,800
And the resonance manifested
itself in the amplitude

225
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,060
response graph with a divergent
asymptote at omega

226
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,870
is equal to 2.

227
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,830
So as you drive the system close
to omega equals 2, the

228
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,370
amplitude of the system
starts to diverge.

229
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,620
In case two we introduced
damping into the system.

230
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,940
So we still have a very large
amplitude response at omega

231
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,980
equals the square root
of 7/2, however

232
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,585
it's no longer infinite.

233
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:17,710

234
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,940
And then lastly, when we
increased damping even further

235
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,630
so we had the 6x dot term,
the presence of a peak

236
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,140
disappeared.

237
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,990
And in fact, the amplitude
response just monotonically

238
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,000
decayed from 1/2 to infinity.

239
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,720
So just constantly
decreased to 0.

240
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,430
So I'd just like to conclude
there, and I'll

241
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,680
see you next time.

242
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,390
