00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000

00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,470
PROFESSOR: Welcome to the
applet, Amplitude and Phase

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,270
Second Order II.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,380
This applet is a sibling of
the applet, Amplitude and

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,830
Phase First Order, which I
used to introduce the MIT

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,380
Mathlet collection.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,520
It's color coding, placement
conventions, and it's

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,750
functionalities are identical
to that one.

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,510
This applet represents a
mechanical system driven by

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,410
the motion of the far
end of the dashpot.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,460
Let's begin by animating the
system to see how this works.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,580
You can see the dashpot
is moving up and down

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,420
sinusoidally, driving
a mass in yellow.

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,180
And the mass is also constrained
by a spring at the

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,390
top, attached to a fixed
wall at the top.

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,890
Perhaps we should animate this
again, so you can see the

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,140
whole thing at work.

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,240

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,340
This applet, and its siblings,
show only the steady state or

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,710
periodic solutions to
these equations.

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,380
They don't allow you to pick
initial conditions.

22
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,490
They don't represent the
effect of transients.

23
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,690
In the applet, x represents the
position of the mass, and

24
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,430
you can see it read
off on this scale.

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,980
It's represented in yellow on
the graphing window here.

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:27,920
And we declare x to be zero when
the spring is exerting no

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,150
force on the mass.

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,480
It's at rest.

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,920
We declare x to be the
output signal of the

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,280
system in the mathlet.

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,440
Y denotes the position of the
plunger, and it's read off by

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,100
this scale here.

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,680
We declare y to be the input
signal of the system.

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,820
Now the force exerted by a
dashpot is proportional to the

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,180
relative velocity of the
cylinder and the piston

36
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,050
sliding inside of it.

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,230
The proportionality constant
is called b.

38
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,560
As a consequence, the right-hand
side of the

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,320
equation controlling
the position of the

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,750
mass is b,y dot --

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,669
b times the time derivative
of y.

42
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,130
This is a good example in which
the right-hand side of a

43
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,770
linear equation in standard
form is not

44
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,490
just the input signal.

45
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,940
In this case, it's not even a
multiple of the input signal.

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,470
It's a multiple of
the derivative

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,751
of the input signal.

48
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:27,390
The most important case to study
is that in which the

49
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,550
input signal is sinusoidal,
and that's what

50
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,400
is represented here.

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,720
In the applet, we take the
amplitude of the input

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,910
signal to be one.

53
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,510
If the amplitude of the input
signal is doubled, so is its

54
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,470
derivative, and so by
superposition the amplitude of

55
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,970
the output signal would
also be doubled.

56
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,160
So setting the input's amplitude
equal to one isn't

57
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,270
really a restriction.

58
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,820
In this situation, when the
input amplitude is one, the

59
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,690
output amplitude is the same
as the gain of the system.

60
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,810
We can see how this output
amplitude depends upon the

61
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,850
input frequency by opening the
Bode Plot window here.

62
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,600
This opens two windows.

63
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,220
The top one represents the
amplitude of the system

64
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,400
response, the gain, as
a function of omega.

65
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,200
And we can start with
omega small.

66
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,420
When omega equals zero, the
plunger isn't moving at all,

67
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,570
and the mass has no reason
to move either.

68
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:36,980
So x equals zero, the spring is
relaxed, there's no motion.

69
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,390
When omega increases,
the system

70
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,510
response becomes greater.

71
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,300
But you'll notice something
interesting.

72
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,290
In this system, when omega is
small, the system response

73
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,170
leads the input signal.

74
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,370
That is to say, the phase
lag is negative.

75
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,380
And that's represented here.

76
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,730
This is a little confusing.

77
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,840
This is a graph of the negative
of the phase lag or

78
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,300
the phase gain.

79
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,160
And that's a positive
angle, in this

80
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,130
system, for omega small.

81
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,320
You can see the effect.

82
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,220
The mass seems to be pulling the
plunger, although that's

83
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,579
not actually what's happening.

84
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,240
When omega increases, the
amplitude of the system

85
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,840
response increases until a
critical moment when omega

86
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,750
takes on some critical value.

87
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,080
This is the resonant frequency
of the system.

88
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,180
And at this point, the system
response is identical to the

89
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,750
input signal.

90
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,000
Shall we see what this looks
like by animating the system?

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Now the plunger seems to be
locked to the piston.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,710
That's not actually the case,
but the system is simply

93
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,650
operating in harmony here.

94
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,500
It's the resonant frequency.

95
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,910
When omega increases still
further, then the system

96
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,080
response falls off.

97
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,440
The phase lag becomes positive,
the response falls

98
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,720
behind the input signal.

99
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,030
And that's all visible from
the Bode plot pictures.

100
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,500
As I look at this, I notice
something interesting.

101
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,540

102
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:27,240
When the system response
reaches a maximum or a

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,630
minimum, that's exactly the same
moment as when the system

104
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,220
response curve crosses the
input signal curve.

105
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,910
So in other words, the amplitude
of the output signal

106
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,500
equals the value of the
input signal at the

107
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,470
moment when they cross.

108
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,600
Let's see if that is always
the case when I change the

109
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,430
frequency here.

110
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,230
That always seems
to be the case.

111
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,450
Very interesting.

112
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,760
And in fact, perhaps we should
change the values of b and k

113
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,270
to see whether that continues
to be the case.

114
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,380
Yes it just seems to drag
up and down there.

115
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,120
And similarly, if I change the
value of the spring constant,

116
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,100
k, again that peak seems to
move up and down along the

117
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,710
blue curve.

118
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,340
Very odd.

119
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,780
We'll come back to that.

120
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,390
Here are some further
observations that you can see

121
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,630
from experimenting
with this applet.

122
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,370
First of all, let's watch what
happens if I change the value

123
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,920
of the damping constant, b.

124
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,740
I'm going to watch the Bode
plot over here, the

125
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,660
amplitude Bode plot.

126
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,310
Well, it changes, but one thing
that doesn't change is

127
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,800
the position of the resonant
peak there.

128
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,130
In other words, the resonant
frequency seems to be

129
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,032
independent of the value of b,
of the damping constant.

130
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:56,670
The second thing you can observe
as I vary b is when b

131
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,770
is large, the resonant hump is
quite broad, but as b becomes

132
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,580
smaller, that spike becomes
narrower and

133
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,680
narrower and narrower.

134
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,820
And the third thing you can
notice from looking at this is

135
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:17,010
as b gets to be small, the
flip between phase lag of

136
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:22,590
close to minus pi over 2 to a
phase lag of close to plus pi

137
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,960
over 2 happens more and more
abruptly as I change the

138
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,720
frequency from something small
and cross through that

139
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,880
resonant peak.

140
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,380
Now the system response is ahead
of the input signal.

141
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,920
But it very quickly flips to
being behind it as you cross

142
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,250
the resonant frequency.

143
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,490
And that transition happens
more and more rapidly as b

144
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,530
gets to be small.

145
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,690
Each one of these three
observations can be verified

146
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,670
by calculation.

147
00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:00,080
The relationship between the
gain and the phase lag can be

148
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,050
illustrated very well using the
Nyquist plot, which I'll

149
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,570
open using this key.

150
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,260

151
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,880
This is a plot of the complex
plane, and on it is drawn a

152
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,850
complex number in yellow.

153
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:24,130
And that complex number has
a magnitude and an angle.

154
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:29,240
The magnitude is the gain.

155
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,750
This yellow strut is the same
length as this radius vector.

156
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,400
And the angle is the negative
of the phase lag.

157
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,270
It's the phase gain.

158
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,760
So when the angle's positive
here, it goes through zero

159
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,080
here and becomes negative down
here, when the phase lag

160
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,650
becomes positive.

161
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:59,590
So you can see why it is that
the resonant peak occurs at

162
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,030
exactly the same instant as when
the phase lag is zero.

163
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:08,850
That says that this trajectory,
this Nyquist plot,

164
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,060
goes through this point, which
is the point 1 in the complex

165
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,880
plane, where the angle is zero
and the magnitude is 1.

166
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,180
This trajectory is in fact
independent of either or both

167
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,610
of the system parameters.

168
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:29,700
If I change them, many things
change, but the shape of this

169
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,970
trajectory, the Nyquist plot,
is independent of those two

170
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,480
system parameters.

171
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,530
And in fact, it's a circle of
radius 1/2 and center 1/2.

172
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,600
You can verify that by
calculation as well.

173
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,130
That fact explains the
observation we made earlier,

174
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:54,480
that the amplitude of the system
response, the gain,

175
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:03,180
seems to be equal to the value
of the input signal when that

176
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,100
maximum is achieved.

177
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,010
In other words, the claim is
that the gain equals the

178
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:16,810
cosine of the phase lag.

179
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,370
The gain is the cosine
of the phase lag.

180
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:29,240
This curve is given by the
equation, the radius equals

181
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,320
the cosine of the angle.

182
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,990
r equals cosine theta is a
polar equation for this

183
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,690
particular circle.

184
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,710
And so the fact that this is a
circle is the same as the fact

185
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:47,710
that we observed earlier, that
the solution curve crosses the

186
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,360
input curve just when
it reaches a

187
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,690
maximum or a minimum.

188
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,210
Well, in addition to the spring
system shown in this

189
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,895
applet, this very same equation
models the response

190
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:01,170
of an A/M radio receiver.

191
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,830
The input signal is the incoming
radio signal, which

192
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,930
contains electromagnetic waves
of many different frequencies.

193
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,630
The output signal feeds
to the amplifier.

194
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,970
You tune the radio to a
particular angular frequency

195
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,400
by adjusting k, the spring
constant, which in the circle

196
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,810
model is the capacitance, so
that the resonant frequency is

197
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,160
the desired frequency that
you want to tune to.

198
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,870
Then the output generated by the
other frequencies is much

199
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,530
less than the output generated
by frequency omega r.

200
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,900
How much less depends on how
sharp the resonance spike is.

201
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,540
The sharper the spike, the
better the tuning.

202
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,250
You can make the spike sharper
by decreasing the value of b,

203
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,150
which in the A/M radio model,
is the resistance.

204
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,348
