1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,750
The damped vibrations applet
illustrates several different

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,720
concepts related to differential
equations.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,350
Initial conditions for second
order equations, the phase

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,690
plane for autonomous equations,
and damping

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,240
conditions for second order
homogeneous linear equations.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,950
The differential we're studying

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,102
appears at upper right.

9
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:24,800
And the parameter names reflect
the fact that this

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,490
equation describes a mass spring
dashpot system, with

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,960
mass m, dashpot constant b,
and spring constant k.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,700
The right hand side of
the equation is zero.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,440
There's no forcing term.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,410
The equation is homogeneous.

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,580
The sliders at bottom control
the values of the system

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,940
parameters.

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,220
With the selected values for
m, b, and k, solutions are

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,540
damped vibrations.

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,770
I can let the solution evolve by
grabbing the time slider or

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,390
by using the animation
key, which also

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,170
serves to stop the animation.

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,170
If the value of the solution
gets too small, I can blow the

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,250
picture up using the zoom slider
at the upper left.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,990
Moving it to the right squeezes
the solutions.

25
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,020
Moving it to the left
makes them larger.

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,984

27
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:28,330
The window on the left lets you
set the initial condition

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,870
of the system.

29
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,220
There are two components to
the initial condition of a

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,880
second order equation.

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,150
Position and velocity,
that is x and x dot.

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,810
Together they form the
coordinates of a

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,120
point on this plane.

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,270
I can grab the point and change
both x and x prime

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,520
simultaneously.

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,430

37
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,260
The x-coordinate is written
vertically, because that's how

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,870
it's written on the right
hand graphing window.

39
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,470
And you can see that they keep
pace with each other.

40
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,889
The horizontal component is x
dot, the initial velocity.

41
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,260
That's positive when we're
to the right, and becomes

42
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,340
negative when we're
to the left.

43
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,110

44
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,130
The left window represents
phase space.

45
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,000
For any time t, the values
of x and x dot are the

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,740
coordinates of a point
in phase space.

47
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,860
And as the solution evolves
through time, that point

48
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,250
follows a path, sweeps out
a path in phase space.

49
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,610
And with these selected choices
of m, b, and k, the

50
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,540
path is a spiral.

51
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,870
This reflects the fact that
both x and x dot undergo a

52
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,101
damped vibration.

53
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:56,780
The system parameters can be
set using these sliders at

54
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,350
lower left.

55
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,870
Let's suggest the mass to be 1/2
and leave k to be one, and

56
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,830
watch what happens to the
solutions as we vary the

57
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,490
damping constant b.

58
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,560
When b is small, the solution
doesn't damp out as quickly,

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,420
and when b is large, it damps
out more quickly.

60
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,400

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,220
These things become much clearer
when you think about

62
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,220
them in terms of the roots of
the characteristic polynomial

63
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,660
of this equation.

64
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,290
And we can display those
roots by clicking the

65
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,340
roots button here.

66
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,120
What's shown here is the complex
plane with the roots

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,860
of the characteristic polynomial
drawn on it.

68
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,440
Also we have a readout of the
two roots in green over here.

69
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,950
So let's watch what happens
when we adjust b.

70
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,930
I'm going to start with
b equal to zero.

71
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,880
In this case, there's
no damping.

72
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,260
The solutions are sinusoidal,
the roots of the

73
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,370
characteristic polynomial are
purely imaginary, and the

74
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,520
trajectory in phase space
is an ellipse.

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,510
Both the solution and its
derivative vary sinusoidally.

76
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:20,120
As I increase b away from
zero, I get spirals.

77
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,780
And at the same time,
the roots move off

78
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,260
the imaginary axis.

79
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,750
They acquire a negative real
part, which is minus b over

80
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,930
2m, incidentally.

81
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,130
And as I increase b further,
the spiral opens up, the

82
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,200
damping occurs more quickly, the
roots move away from the

83
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,860
imaginary axis.

84
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,560
They increase the size
of their real part.

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,040
The damping occurs
more quickly.

86
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,050
And you'll notice that they get
closer and closer to the

87
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,460
real axis as well.

88
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,000
Their imaginary part
is decreasing.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,050
That means that the circular
frequency, the angular

90
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,470
frequency of the solution,
is decreasing.

91
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,060
The period, or pseudo-period of
the solution is decreasing.

92
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,050
You can see that in the graph,
but it's much clearer to see

93
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,810
what's happening to these roots
of the characteristic

94
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,840
polynomial.

95
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,360
There are converging on the real
axis, and eventually they

96
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,490
merge into a double root
on the real axis.

97
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,740
This is critical damping.

98
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,440

99
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:40,970
From the readout, we see that
the value of b seems to be

100
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,120
about 1.41.

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
Why don't you take a moment and
calculate what b is for

102
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,435
these values of m and k when
critical damping occurs?

103
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:55,540

104
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,200
If we continue to increase b
beyond critical damping, now

105
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,400
the roots move out
on the real axis.

106
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,440
There are two exponential
solutions, and the general

107
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,450
solution is a linear combination
of them.

108
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,100
And there's no oscillation
in any solution.

109
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,882
