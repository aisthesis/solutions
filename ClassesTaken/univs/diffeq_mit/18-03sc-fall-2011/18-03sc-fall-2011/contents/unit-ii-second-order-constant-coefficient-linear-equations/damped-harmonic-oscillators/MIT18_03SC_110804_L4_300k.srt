00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,410
PROFESSOR: Welcome to this
recitation on damped harmonic

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,380
oscillators.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,160
So here you're asked to assume
an enforced, overdamped

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,960
spring-mass-dashpot that started
at x dot of 0 close to

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,200
0, so rest, and to show that
it never crosses the

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,430
equilibrium position, x equal
to 0, for t larger then 0.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,730
The second part of the problem
asks you to show that

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,670
regardless of the initial
condition, this overdamped

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,160
oscillator can not cross the
equilibrium position more than

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,490
one time, or more than once.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,780
OK.

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,580
So why don't you pause the
video, try to think about this

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,950
problem, and I'll
be right back.

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:51,290

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,900
Welcome back.

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,820
So the system that we're
looking at is a

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:05,760
spring-mass-dashpot that would
be written in this form--

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,990
second order differential
equation.

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,840
Let's assume that we have
positive constant

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,190
coefficients here.

22
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:21,300
And basically, to solve this,
you would be considering the

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,230
methods that we saw before.

24
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:29,400
And the general solution would
just be written in the form of

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,310
c1 exponential lambda 1, the c2
exponential lambda 2, with

26
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,200
c1, c2, just two constants that
would be determined by

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,120
the initial condition.

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,140
Lambda 1, lambda 2 would be
here the roots of the

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,080
characteristic polynomial that
you would have found there.

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,980
Given that we're looking
at an overdamped forced

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,960
spring-mass-dashpot, you can
actually show that lambda 1

32
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,290
and lambda 2 would be both
real and negative.

33
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,710

34
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,270
And here, we can just say that
basically, lambda 1 and lambda

35
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,150
2 would be less than 1.

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:18,010
And we'll keep that aside for
now, and I'll use this later.

37
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,440
So this is just setting
up the problem.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,870
So now, what was the question?

39
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,750
The question was to show that
if we start this system with

40
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:33,230
initial condition x dot of 0
equal to 0, which corresponds

41
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,800
to lambda 1 c1 plus lambda 2
c2 equals to 0, then the

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,330
system cannot cross the
equilibrium position x equal

43
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,500
to 0 for t larger than 0.

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,040
So let's just start by assuming
that the system

45
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,550
crosses the equilibrium
position.

46
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:57,330
So for example, let's look for
t star such that x of t star

47
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,980
is equal to 0.

48
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,370
So x of t star, we know
its form already.

49
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,040
We have the general form
of x of t star.

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,276
That's basically c1 exponential
lambda 1 t star

51
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:12,690
plus c2 exponential
lambda 2 t star.

52
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,345
And so we can massage this
equation, and basically end up

53
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:27,130
with minus c2 over c1 equal to
exponential of lambda 1 minus

54
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,070
lambda 2 t star.

55
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,670
So now let's just find our t
star by applying the log of

56
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,400
both sides of this equation.

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,960
So we get t star equals to the
log of minus c2 over c1, and

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,020
we divide by the lambda
1 minus lambda 2.

59
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,040
So here this tells us that if t
star exists, which means, if

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,130
the log is defined, and this
minus c2 over c1 basically is

61
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,980
positive, then we only have one
value of t star possible.

62
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,720
So here, we actually are
answering the second part of

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,190
this question, number two,
which was telling us that

64
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,302
regardless of the initial
condition-- so regardless of

65
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:13,730
the coefficient c1 c2
that we would have--

66
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,990
if t star exists, there
is only one.

67
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,365
And so that means that the
system would not cross this

68
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:21,019
equilibrium position
more than once.

69
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,650
But I'll come back on that.

70
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,950
But now let's go back to what
we were asked to do in the

71
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:32,120
first part, where we basically
now go back to our x dot of 0

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,590
equals to 0, which basically
gave us that minus c2 over c1

73
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,720
is equal to lambda 1 over
lambda 2, and the way we

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,780
define lambda 1 over lambda 2
here gives us that minus c2

75
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,130
over c1 is less than 1, which
means that the log is going to

76
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,410
be negative.

77
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,070
What happens in the
denominator?

78
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,820
Lambda 1 minus lambda
2 would be positive.

79
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,570
So with this initial condition,
we would end up

80
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,410
with a t star that would
be negative.

81
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:16,360
So basically, x is never equal
to 0 again for t larger than

82
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,410
0, given these initial
conditions.

83
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,760
So that finishes this first
part of the problem.

84
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,400
So I'll go back on the
physics of it in a

85
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,080
moment with a graph.

86
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,400
So starting from this initial
condition, x can never be

87
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,510
equal to 0, because the
only t star we can

88
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,720
find would be negative.

89
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,240
So for t larger than 0,
it does not cross

90
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,520
the equilibrium point.

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,970
The second part of
the problem--

92
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,480
so this was 1--

93
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,680
just comes from the fact that,
if I label this star, star

94
00:05:48,680 --> 00:06:00,620
tells us that if minus c2 over
c1, strictly larger than 0,

95
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,290
then only 1 t star exists.

96
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:11,250
So if we have a solution,
there is only one.

97
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,680
And this is regardless of the
initial conditions that we

98
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,570
would be given.

99
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,670
So the system cannot cross
the equilibrium

100
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,300
position more than once.

101
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,755
So now let's look at what we're
doing here, graphically.

102
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:26,620

103
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,010
Let's assume that we're, for
example, starting with initial

104
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,810
condition here, where we're
stretching our spring, but we

105
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,970
start with 0 velocity.

106
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,010
So x dot of 0 equal to 0.

107
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,810
That was the system
that we had.

108
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,350
Then this is an overdamped
case where both basically

109
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,480
exponentials are decaying to
0, and so we would have a

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,315
solution that would
go to 0 quickly.

111
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:51,480
It would be damped.

112
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,010
And so this would be part 1.

113
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,160
Now let's look at what would
happen if we started with

114
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,620
other initial conditions.

115
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:05,310
So for example, starting from
the same point with a much

116
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,370
bigger velocity.

117
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,130
Then the system would go
up, but eventually,

118
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,370
it has to go down.

119
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,140
It wouldn't have this shape, but
basically, it would have

120
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,730
to go down to 0's position.

121
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,560
And when it reaches, you can
show that again, the

122
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,950
derivative of x can
reach 0 only once.

123
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,920
And at that point, you're then
back to the initial conditions

124
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,270
that you had in the first part
of the question, and so you

125
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,850
can then, from here, argue again
that you cannot cross

126
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,410
the zero, the equilibrium
point,

127
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,290
after reaching a maximum.

128
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:46,740
Now what if we had a stretch
that would be giving a

129
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,230
negative velocity to the
mass, and a very

130
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,680
strong negative velocity?

131
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,840
Then the system also
wants to go back to

132
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,910
0, but could overshoot.

133
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,210
And the overshoot would also
generate a unique time at

134
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,970
which the derivative would be
equal to 0, and after that

135
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,160
point, you would be back to
the same argument we had

136
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,500
before, where the solution would
have to go toward 0, but

137
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,600
never crosses it.

138
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,010
So we can have various
configurations.

139
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,900
And here I start with this
point, but you could also

140
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,680
start with other initial
conditions, where you could

141
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,540
have, as well, something that
would be, for example, a very

142
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:35,460
strong positive, where again,
here you would have an

143
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,480
overshoot, but then the solution
would be attracted by

144
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,220
the x equal to 0 solution.

145
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,740
And of course you could also
start from the equilibrium.

146
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,990
If you're not imposing any
initial velocity, you just

147
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,850
stay there, because this
is not forced.

148
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,930
But if you're imposing a
velocity, then you would have

149
00:08:50,930 --> 00:09:01,390
other trajectories of the kind,
for example, like this,

150
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,550
where again, it would go up, but
then be attracted back by

151
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,730
the 0 solution.

152
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,510
So that's the typical behavior
for a damped oscillator, where

153
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,930
basically there's no
oscillation, but the solution

154
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,860
is attracted to rest. And you
could have cases of overshoot

155
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,760
when it can show that after the
overshoot, velocity would

156
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,120
reach 0 maximum, and then would
be attracted back to the

157
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
0 solution with never
crossing it.

158
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,450
And that ends this recitation.

159
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,813
