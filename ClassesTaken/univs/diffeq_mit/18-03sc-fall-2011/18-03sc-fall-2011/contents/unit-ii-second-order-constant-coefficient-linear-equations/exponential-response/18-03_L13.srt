1
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11
The task for today is to find
particular solutions.

2
00:00:09 --> 00:00:15
So, let me remind you where
we've gotten to.

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:18
We're talking about the
second-order equation with

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
constant coefficients,
which you can think of as

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
modeling springs,
or simple electrical circuits.

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:31
But, what's different now is
that the right-hand side is an

7
00:00:29 --> 00:00:35
input which is not zero.
So, we are considering,

8
00:00:35 --> 00:00:41
I'm going to use x as your book
does, keeping to a neutral

9
00:00:41 --> 00:00:47
letter.
But, again, in the

10
00:00:43 --> 00:00:49
applications,
and in many of the applications

11
00:00:48 --> 00:00:54
at any rate, it wants to be t.
But, I make it x.

12
00:00:54 --> 00:01:00
So, the independent variable is
x, and the problem is,

13
00:00:59 --> 00:01:05
remember, that to find a
particular solution,

14
00:01:04 --> 00:01:10
and the reason why we want to
do that is then the general

15
00:01:10 --> 00:01:16
solution will be of the form y
equals that particular solution

16
00:01:17 --> 00:01:23
plus the complementary solution,
the general solution to the

17
00:01:23 --> 00:01:29
reduced equation,
which we can write this way.

18
00:01:30 --> 00:01:36
So, all the work depends upon
finding out what that yp is,

19
00:01:34 --> 00:01:40
and that's what we're going to
talk about today,

20
00:01:37 --> 00:01:43
or rather, talk about for two
weeks.

21
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
But, the point is,
not all functions that you

22
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
could write on the right-hand
side are equally interesting.

23
00:01:47 --> 00:01:53
There's one kind,
which is far more interesting,

24
00:01:50 --> 00:01:56
but more important in the
applications than all the

25
00:01:54 --> 00:02:00
others.
And, that's the one out of

26
00:01:56 --> 00:02:02
which, in fact,
as you will see later on this

27
00:02:00 --> 00:02:06
week and into next week,
an arbitrary function can be

28
00:02:03 --> 00:02:09
built out of these simple
functions.

29
00:02:08 --> 00:02:14
So, the important function is
on the right-hand side to be

30
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
able to solve it when it's a
simple exponential.

31
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
But, if you allow me to make it
a complex exponential,

32
00:02:22 --> 00:02:28
so, here are the important
right-hand sides where we want,

33
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
we want to be able to do it
when it's of the form,

34
00:02:31 --> 00:02:37
e to the ax.
In general, that will be,

35
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
in most applications,
a is not a growing exponential,

36
00:02:40 --> 00:02:46
but a decaying exponential.
So, typically,

37
00:02:43 --> 00:02:49
a is negative.
But, it doesn't have to be.

38
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
I'll put it in parentheses,
though, often.

39
00:02:48 --> 00:02:54
That's not any assumption that
I'm going to make today.

40
00:02:52 --> 00:02:58
It's just culture.
But, we want to be able to do

41
00:02:56 --> 00:03:02
it for sine omega x and cosine
omega x.

42
00:02:59 --> 00:03:05
In other words,

43
00:03:03 --> 00:03:09
when the right-hand side is a
pure oscillation,

44
00:03:06 --> 00:03:12
that's another important type
of input both for electrical

45
00:03:11 --> 00:03:17
circuits, think alternating
current, or the spring systems.

46
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
That's a pure vibration is
you're imposing pure vibration

47
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
on the spring-mass-dashpot
system, and you want to see how

48
00:03:24 --> 00:03:30
it responds to that.
Or, you could put them

49
00:03:27 --> 00:03:33
together, and make these
decaying oscillations.

50
00:03:32 --> 00:03:38
So, we could also have
something like e to the ax times

51
00:03:36 --> 00:03:42
sine omega x,
or times cosine omega x.

52
00:03:41 --> 00:03:47
Now, the point is,

53
00:03:45 --> 00:03:51
all of these together are
really just special cases of one

54
00:03:50 --> 00:03:56
general thing,
exponential,

55
00:03:52 --> 00:03:58
if you allow the exponent not
to be a real number,

56
00:03:56 --> 00:04:02
but to be a complex number.
So, they're all special cases

57
00:04:02 --> 00:04:08
of e to the, I'll write it alpha
x,

58
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
well, why don't we write it (a
plus i omega) x, right?

59
00:04:14 --> 00:04:20
If omega is zero,

60
00:04:16 --> 00:04:22
then I've got this case.
If a is zero,

61
00:04:20 --> 00:04:26
I got this case separating into
its real and imaginary parts.

62
00:04:26 --> 00:04:32
And, if neither is zero,
I have this case.

63
00:04:32 --> 00:04:38
But, I don't want to keep
writing (a plus i omega) all the

64
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42
time.
So, I'm going to write that

65
00:04:38 --> 00:04:44
simply as e to the alpha x.

66
00:04:41 --> 00:04:47
And, you understand that alpha
is a complex number now.

67
00:04:45 --> 00:04:51
It doesn't look like a real
number.

68
00:04:48 --> 00:04:54
Okay, so the complex number.
So, the equation we are solving

69
00:04:52 --> 00:04:58
is which one?
This pretty purple equation.

70
00:04:55 --> 00:05:01
And, we are trying to find a
particular solution of it.

71
00:04:59 --> 00:05:05
And, the special functions we
are going to use are these,

72
00:05:03 --> 00:05:09
well, this one in particular,
e to the alpha x.

73
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
That's going to be our input.

74
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
Now, it turns out this is
amazingly easy to do because

75
00:05:19 --> 00:05:25
it's an exponential because I
write it in exponential form.

76
00:05:26 --> 00:05:32
The idea is simply to use a
rule which, in fact,

77
00:05:32 --> 00:05:38
you know already,
the rule of substitution.

78
00:05:38 --> 00:05:44
So, I'm going to write the
equation in the form,

79
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
so, there it is.
It's y double prime plus A y

80
00:05:48 --> 00:05:54
prime plus B y equals f of x.

81
00:05:55 --> 00:06:01
But, I'm going to think of the
left-hand side as the polynomial

82
00:06:02 --> 00:06:08
operator, AD plus B.
A and B are constants,

83
00:06:07 --> 00:06:13
applied to y equals f of x.

84
00:06:10 --> 00:06:16
That's the way I write the
thing.

85
00:06:13 --> 00:06:19
And, this part,
I'm going to think of in the

86
00:06:16 --> 00:06:22
form.
This is p of D,

87
00:06:18 --> 00:06:24
a polynomial in D.
In fact, it's a simple

88
00:06:21 --> 00:06:27
quadratic polynomial.
But, most of what I'm going to

89
00:06:25 --> 00:06:31
say today would apply equally
well if we were a higher order

90
00:06:29 --> 00:06:35
polynomial, a polynomial of
higher degree.

91
00:06:34 --> 00:06:40
And, just to reinforce the
idea, I've given you one problem

92
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
in your problem set when p is a
polynomial of higher degree.

93
00:06:42 --> 00:06:48
I should say,
the notes are written for

94
00:06:44 --> 00:06:50
general polynomials,
not just for quadratic ones.

95
00:06:48 --> 00:06:54
I'm simplifying it by leaving
it, today, I'll do what's in the

96
00:06:52 --> 00:06:58
notes, but I'll do it in the
quadratic case to save a little

97
00:06:56 --> 00:07:02
time, and because that's the one
you will be most concerned with

98
00:07:00 --> 00:07:06
in the problems.
All right, so p of D y equals f

99
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
of x.
And now, there are just a

100
00:07:09 --> 00:07:15
couple of basic formulas that
we're going to use all the time.

101
00:07:15 --> 00:07:21
The first is that if you apply
p of D to a complex

102
00:07:19 --> 00:07:25
exponential, or a real one,
it doesn't matter,

103
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
the answer is you get just what
you started with,

104
00:07:27 --> 00:07:33
with D substituted by alpha.
So, it's p of alpha.

105
00:07:32 --> 00:07:38
In other words,
put an alpha wherever you saw a

106
00:07:36 --> 00:07:42
D in the polynomial.
And, what is this?

107
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
Well, this is now just an
ordinary complex number,

108
00:07:43 --> 00:07:49
and multiply that by what you
started with,

109
00:07:46 --> 00:07:52
e to the alpha x.

110
00:07:48 --> 00:07:54
So, that's a basic formula.
It's called in the notes the

111
00:07:52 --> 00:07:58
substitution rule because the
heart of it is,

112
00:07:55 --> 00:08:01
you substitute for the D,
you substitute alpha.

113
00:08:00 --> 00:08:06
Now, this hardly requires
proof.

114
00:08:02 --> 00:08:08
But, let's prove it just so you
see, to reinforce things and

115
00:08:07 --> 00:08:13
make things go a little more
slowly to make sure you are on

116
00:08:12 --> 00:08:18
board all the time.
How would I prove that?

117
00:08:15 --> 00:08:21
Well, just calculate it out,
what in fact is (D squared plus

118
00:08:20 --> 00:08:26
AD plus B) times e to the alpha
x.

119
00:08:25 --> 00:08:31
Well, it's D squared e to the
alpha x by linearity plus AD

120
00:08:30 --> 00:08:36
times e to the alpha x plus B
times e to the alpha x.

121
00:08:34 --> 00:08:40

122
00:08:40 --> 00:08:46
Well, what are these?
What's the derivative of e to

123
00:08:43 --> 00:08:49
the alpha x?
It's just alpha times e to the

124
00:08:46 --> 00:08:52
alpha x.
What's a second derivative?

125
00:08:50 --> 00:08:56
Well, if you remember from the
exam, you can do tenth

126
00:08:53 --> 00:08:59
derivatives now.
So, the second derivative is

127
00:08:56 --> 00:09:02
easy.
It's alpha squared times e to

128
00:08:58 --> 00:09:04
the alpha x.

129
00:09:00 --> 00:09:06
In other words,
this law, what I'm saying

130
00:09:03 --> 00:09:09
really is that this law is
obviously, quote unquote,

131
00:09:06 --> 00:09:12
"true."
Okay, I'm not even going to put

132
00:09:10 --> 00:09:16
it in quotes.
It's obviously true for the

133
00:09:12 --> 00:09:18
operator, D, and the operator D
squared.

134
00:09:16 --> 00:09:22
In other words,
D of e to the alpha x equals

135
00:09:19 --> 00:09:25
alpha times e to the alpha x.

136
00:09:22 --> 00:09:28
D squared times e to the alpha

137
00:09:25 --> 00:09:31
x equals alpha squared times e
to the alpha x.

138
00:09:30 --> 00:09:36
And, therefore,

139
00:09:34 --> 00:09:40
it's true for linear
combinations of these as well by

140
00:09:37 --> 00:09:43
linearity.
So, therefore,

141
00:09:39 --> 00:09:45
also true for p of D.
And, in fact,

142
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
so if you calculate it out,
what is it?

143
00:09:45 --> 00:09:51
This is alpha squared e to the
alpha x plus alpha e to the

144
00:09:50 --> 00:09:56
alpha x times the

145
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
coefficient plus b times e to
the alpha x.

146
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
So, it's in fact exactly this.
It's e to the alpha x times

147
00:10:04 --> 00:10:10
(alpha squared plus A alpha plus
B).

148
00:10:10 --> 00:10:16
Now, how are we going to use

149
00:10:13 --> 00:10:19
this?
Well, the idea is very simple.

150
00:10:16 --> 00:10:22
Remember, we're trying to solve
this, I should have some

151
00:10:21 --> 00:10:27
consistent notation for these
equations.

152
00:10:25 --> 00:10:31
Purple, I think,
will be the right thing here.

153
00:10:28 --> 00:10:34
You are solving purple
equations.

154
00:10:33 --> 00:10:39
The formulas which will solve
them will be orange formulas,

155
00:10:38 --> 00:10:44
and we will see what we need as
we go along.

156
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
So, I would like to just
formulate it,

157
00:10:45 --> 00:10:51
this solution,
the particular solution now.

158
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
I'm going to call it a theorem.
It's really too simple to be a

159
00:10:54 --> 00:11:00
theorem.
On the other hand,

160
00:10:57 --> 00:11:03
it's too important not to be a
theorem.

161
00:11:02 --> 00:11:08
So, let's call it,
as I called it in the notes,

162
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
the exponential input theorem,
which says it all.

163
00:11:11 --> 00:11:17
Theorem says it's important.
Exponential input means it's

164
00:11:17 --> 00:11:23
taking f of x to be an
exponential.

165
00:11:21 --> 00:11:27
It's an exponential input,
and the theorem tells you what

166
00:11:27 --> 00:11:33
the response is.
So, for that equation,

167
00:11:33 --> 00:11:39
I'm not going to recopy the
equation for the purple

168
00:11:40 --> 00:11:46
equation, adequately indicated
this way.

169
00:11:46 --> 00:11:52
There.
Now try to take notes.

170
00:11:51 --> 00:11:57
For the purple equation,
a solution is e to the alpha x.

171
00:11:59 --> 00:12:05
Somewhere I neglected to say

172
00:12:05 --> 00:12:11
that f of x, all right,
so for the purple equals e to

173
00:12:09 --> 00:12:15
the alpha x, how about that?

174
00:12:14 --> 00:12:20
That equation,
y double prime plus a y prime

175
00:12:17 --> 00:12:23
plus b y equals e to
the alpha x.

176
00:12:22 --> 00:12:28
So, here's the exponential

177
00:12:25 --> 00:12:31
input.
The solution is e to the alpha

178
00:12:28 --> 00:12:34
x divided by p of alpha.

179
00:12:34 --> 00:12:40
Now, that's a very useful
formula.

180
00:12:36 --> 00:12:42
In fact, Haynes Miller,
who also teaches this course,

181
00:12:40 --> 00:12:46
in his notes calls of the most
important theorem in the course.

182
00:12:45 --> 00:12:51
Well, I don't have to totally
agree with him,

183
00:12:49 --> 00:12:55
but it's certainly important.
It's probably the most

184
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
important theorem for these two
weeks, anyway.

185
00:12:57 --> 00:13:03
But, you will have others as
well.

186
00:12:59 --> 00:13:05
Okay, so that's a theorem.
The theorem is going green.

187
00:13:03 --> 00:13:09
You can tell what they are by
their color code.

188
00:13:09 --> 00:13:15
Well, in other words,
what I've done is simply write

189
00:13:12 --> 00:13:18
down the solution for you,
write down the particular

190
00:13:16 --> 00:13:22
solution.
But let's verify it in general.

191
00:13:19 --> 00:13:25
So, the proof would be what?
Well, I have to substitute it

192
00:13:24 --> 00:13:30
into the equation.
So, the equation is p of D

193
00:13:27 --> 00:13:33
applied to y is equal to alpha
x.

194
00:13:31 --> 00:13:37
And, I want to know,
when I substitute that

195
00:13:34 --> 00:13:40
expression in,
is it the case that when I plug

196
00:13:37 --> 00:13:43
it in, that the right-hand side,
I calculate it out,

197
00:13:41 --> 00:13:47
apply p of D to it.
Is it the case that I get e to

198
00:13:46 --> 00:13:52
the alpha x on the right?

199
00:13:49 --> 00:13:55
Well, all you have to do is do
it.

200
00:13:51 --> 00:13:57
What is p of D applied to e to
the alpha x divided by p of

201
00:13:56 --> 00:14:02
alpha?

202
00:14:00 --> 00:14:06
Well, p of D applied to e to
the alpha x is p of alpha times

203
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
e to the alpha x.

204
00:14:07 --> 00:14:13
That's the substitution rule.
What about this guy?

205
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
This guy is a constant,
so it just gets dragged along

206
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
because this operator is linear.
If this applied to that is

207
00:14:17 --> 00:14:23
this, then if I apply it to one
half that, I get one half the

208
00:14:21 --> 00:14:27
answer, and so on.
So, the p of alpha

209
00:14:24 --> 00:14:30
is a constant and just gets
dragged along.

210
00:14:27 --> 00:14:33
And now, they cancel each
other, and the answer is,

211
00:14:30 --> 00:14:36
indeed, e to the alpha x.

212
00:14:34 --> 00:14:40
That's not much of a proof.
I hope that to at least half

213
00:14:39 --> 00:14:45
this class, you're wondering,
yes, but what if Peter had not

214
00:14:45 --> 00:14:51
caught the wolf?
I mean, what if?

215
00:14:48 --> 00:14:54
What if?

216
00:14:50 --> 00:14:56

217
00:15:01 --> 00:15:07
I'm looking stern.
Okay, we will take care of it

218
00:15:04 --> 00:15:10
in the simplest possible way.
We will assume that p of alpha

219
00:15:10 --> 00:15:16
is not zero.
The case p of alpha is zero

220
00:15:13 --> 00:15:19
is, in fact,
an extremely important

221
00:15:17 --> 00:15:23
case, one that makes the world
go 'round, one that contributes

222
00:15:22 --> 00:15:28
to all sorts of catastrophes,
and they occur first here in

223
00:15:27 --> 00:15:33
the solution of differential
equations, and that's what

224
00:15:32 --> 00:15:38
controls all the catastrophes.
But, there's a good side to it,

225
00:15:37 --> 00:15:43
too.
It also makes a lot of good

226
00:15:39 --> 00:15:45
things happen.
So, there are no moral

227
00:15:41 --> 00:15:47
judgments in mathematics.
For the time being,

228
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
let's assume p of alpha is not
zero.

229
00:15:46 --> 00:15:52
And, that proof is okay because
the p of alpha,

230
00:15:48 --> 00:15:54
being in the denominator,
it's okay to be in the

231
00:15:51 --> 00:15:57
denominator if you're not zero.
Okay, let's work in a simple

232
00:15:55 --> 00:16:01
example.
Well, I'm picking the most

233
00:15:56 --> 00:16:02
complicated example I can think
of.

234
00:16:00 --> 00:16:06
Simple examples,
I'll leave for your practice

235
00:16:04 --> 00:16:10
and for the recitations,
can start off with simple

236
00:16:08 --> 00:16:14
examples if you are confused by
this.

237
00:16:12 --> 00:16:18
But, let's solve an equation,
find a particular solution.

238
00:16:17 --> 00:16:23
So, y double prime plus minus y
prime plus 2y is equal to 10 e

239
00:16:23 --> 00:16:29
to the minus x sine x.

240
00:16:29 --> 00:16:35
Gulp.
Okay, so, the input is this

241
00:16:33 --> 00:16:39
function, 10 e to the minus x,

242
00:16:36 --> 00:16:42
it's a decaying oscillation.
You're seeing those already on

243
00:16:40 --> 00:16:46
the computer screen if you
started your homework,

244
00:16:44 --> 00:16:50
if you've done problem one on
your homework.

245
00:16:47 --> 00:16:53
It's a decaying exponential,
and I want to find a particular

246
00:16:52 --> 00:16:58
solution.
Well, let's find a particular

247
00:16:55 --> 00:17:01
and the general solution.
Find the general solution.

248
00:17:00 --> 00:17:06
Well, the main part of the work
is finding the particular

249
00:17:05 --> 00:17:11
solution, but let's quickly,
the general solution,

250
00:17:10 --> 00:17:16
let's find first the
complementary part of it,

251
00:17:14 --> 00:17:20
in other words,
the solution to the homogeneous

252
00:17:19 --> 00:17:25
equation.
That's D squared minus D plus

253
00:17:22 --> 00:17:28
two. No, let's not.

254
00:17:26 --> 00:17:32
I don't want to solve messy
quadratics.

255
00:17:31 --> 00:17:37
Okay, we're going to find a
particular solution.

256
00:17:34 --> 00:17:40
I thought it was going to come
out easy, and then I realized it

257
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
wasn't because I picked the
wrong signs.

258
00:17:43 --> 00:17:49
Okay, so if you don't like,
just change the problem.

259
00:17:47 --> 00:17:53
I can do that,
but you cannot.

260
00:17:49 --> 00:17:55
Don't forget that.
So, we want a particular

261
00:17:53 --> 00:17:59
solution in our equation.
It is this equals that.

262
00:17:57 --> 00:18:03
Now, let's complexify it to
make this part of a complex

263
00:18:01 --> 00:18:07
exponential.
So, the complex exponential

264
00:18:06 --> 00:18:12
that's relevant is ten times e
to the (minus one plus i),

265
00:18:12 --> 00:18:18
you see that? x.

266
00:18:15 --> 00:18:21
What is this?
This is the imaginary part of

267
00:18:19 --> 00:18:25
this complex exponential.
So, this is imaginary part of

268
00:18:24 --> 00:18:30
that guy, e to the negative x
times e to the i x,

269
00:18:29 --> 00:18:35
and the imaginary part of e to

270
00:18:33 --> 00:18:39
the i x.

271
00:18:39 --> 00:18:45
The ten, of course,
just comes along for the ride.

272
00:18:42 --> 00:18:48
Okay, well, now,
since this is a complex

273
00:18:44 --> 00:18:50
equation, I shouldn't call this
y anymore by my notation.

274
00:18:48 --> 00:18:54
I like to call it y tilde to
indicate that the solution we

275
00:18:52 --> 00:18:58
get to this is not going to be
the original solution to the

276
00:18:56 --> 00:19:02
original problem,
but you will have to take the

277
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
imaginary part of it to get it.
So, we are looking,

278
00:19:03 --> 00:19:09
now, for the complex solution
to this complexified equation.

279
00:19:08 --> 00:19:14
Okay, what is it?
Well, the complex particular

280
00:19:11 --> 00:19:17
solution I can write down
immediately.

281
00:19:14 --> 00:19:20
It is ten, that,
of course, just gets dragged

282
00:19:18 --> 00:19:24
along by linearity,
times e to the (minus one plus

283
00:19:22 --> 00:19:28
i) times x.
And, it's over this polynomial

284
00:19:27 --> 00:19:33
evaluated at this alpha.
So, just write it down with,

285
00:19:31 --> 00:19:37
have faith.
So, what do I get?

286
00:19:33 --> 00:19:39
The alpha is minus one plus i.

287
00:19:36 --> 00:19:42
I.
square that,

288
00:19:37 --> 00:19:43
because I'm substituting this
alpha into that polynomial.

289
00:19:41 --> 00:19:47
The reason I'm doing that is
because the formula tells me to

290
00:19:45 --> 00:19:51
do it.
That's going to be that

291
00:19:47 --> 00:19:53
solution.
Okay, so it's minus one plus i,

292
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
the quantity squared, minus
minus one plus i plus two.

293
00:19:54 --> 00:20:00
All I've done is substitute

294
00:19:58 --> 00:20:04
minus one plus i for
D in that polynomial,

295
00:20:01 --> 00:20:07
the quadratic polynomial.
And now, all I want is the

296
00:20:07 --> 00:20:13
imaginary part of this.
The imaginary part of this will

297
00:20:12 --> 00:20:18
be the solution to the original
problem because this was the

298
00:20:18 --> 00:20:24
right hand side with the
imaginary part of the

299
00:20:22 --> 00:20:28
complexified right hand side.
Okay, now, let's make it look a

300
00:20:28 --> 00:20:34
little better,
yp tilde.

301
00:20:32 --> 00:20:38
Clearly, what we have to do
something nice to the

302
00:20:34 --> 00:20:40
denominator.
So, I'll copy the numerator.

303
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
That's e to the minus (one plus
i) x

304
00:20:40 --> 00:20:46
and how about the denominator?
Well, again,

305
00:20:43 --> 00:20:49
don't expand things out because
it's already this long.

306
00:20:46 --> 00:20:52
And, what's the point of making
it this long?

307
00:20:48 --> 00:20:54
You want to make it as long,
right?

308
00:20:50 --> 00:20:56
Okay, then there is room here
for one real number,

309
00:20:53 --> 00:20:59
and another real number times
i, there's no more room.

310
00:20:57 --> 00:21:03
Okay, what's the real number?
Okay, we're looking for the

311
00:21:02 --> 00:21:08
real part of this expression.
So, just put it in and keep it

312
00:21:07 --> 00:21:13
mentally.
So, minus one squared:

313
00:21:09 --> 00:21:15
that's one, plus i squared,
that's minus one.

314
00:21:13 --> 00:21:19
One minus one is zero.
I can forget about that term.

315
00:21:18 --> 00:21:24
The term gives me plus one for
the real part,

316
00:21:21 --> 00:21:27
plus two.
The answer is that the real

317
00:21:24 --> 00:21:30
part is three.
How about the imaginary part?

318
00:21:28 --> 00:21:34
Well, from here,
there's negative 2i,

319
00:21:31 --> 00:21:37
negative 2i.
I'm expanding that out by the

320
00:21:38 --> 00:21:44
binomial theorem,
or whatever you like to call

321
00:21:44 --> 00:21:50
that, minus 2i minus i makes
minus 3i.

322
00:21:51 --> 00:21:57
Is that right?
Minus 2i, minus i,

323
00:21:56 --> 00:22:02
minus 3i.
So, it is ten thirds,

324
00:22:00 --> 00:22:06
and now in the denominator I
have one minus i.

325
00:22:08 --> 00:22:14
I'll put that in the numerator,
make it one plus i,

326
00:22:12 --> 00:22:18
but I have to divide by the
product of one minus i and its

327
00:22:17 --> 00:22:23
complex conjugate.
In other words,

328
00:22:20 --> 00:22:26
I'm multiplying both top and
bottom by one plus i.

329
00:22:24 --> 00:22:30
And so, that makes here one
squared plus one squared is two.

330
00:22:30 --> 00:22:36
And now, what's left is e to
the negative x times cosine x

331
00:22:35 --> 00:22:41
plus i sine x.

332
00:22:40 --> 00:22:46
Now, of that,
what we want is just the

333
00:22:43 --> 00:22:49
imaginary part.
Well, let's see.

334
00:22:46 --> 00:22:52
Two goes into ten makes five,
so that's five thirds.

335
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
So, we're practically at our
solution.

336
00:22:55 --> 00:23:01
The solution,
then, finally,

337
00:22:58 --> 00:23:04
is going to be yp is the
imaginary part of yp tilde.

338
00:23:05 --> 00:23:11
And, what's that?
Well, what's the coefficient

339
00:23:08 --> 00:23:14
out front, first of all?
It's five thirds,

340
00:23:12 --> 00:23:18
so let's pull out to five
thirds before we forget it.

341
00:23:16 --> 00:23:22
And, we'll pull out the e to
the negative x before we forget

342
00:23:21 --> 00:23:27
that.
And then, the rest is simply a

343
00:23:24 --> 00:23:30
question of seeing what's left.
Well, it's one.

344
00:23:28 --> 00:23:34
I want the imaginary part.
So, the imaginary part is going

345
00:23:33 --> 00:23:39
to be one times cosine x,
and then the other

346
00:23:37 --> 00:23:43
imaginary part comes from these
two pieces, which is one times

347
00:23:42 --> 00:23:48
sine x.
And, that should be the

348
00:23:47 --> 00:23:53
particular solution.
Notice that most of the work is

349
00:23:52 --> 00:23:58
not getting this thing.
It's turning it into something

350
00:23:56 --> 00:24:02
human that you can take the real
and imaginary parts of.

351
00:24:02 --> 00:24:08
If we don't like this form,
you can put it in the other

352
00:24:07 --> 00:24:13
form, which many engineers would
do almost automatically,

353
00:24:12 --> 00:24:18
make it five thirds,
e to the negative x,

354
00:24:16 --> 00:24:22
and what will that be?
Well, you can use the general

355
00:24:21 --> 00:24:27
formula if you want.
Remember, cosine,

356
00:24:24 --> 00:24:30
the two coefficients are one
and one, so it's one and one.

357
00:24:30 --> 00:24:36
So, this is the square root of
two.

358
00:24:33 --> 00:24:39
So, it is times,
this part makes the square root

359
00:24:37 --> 00:24:43
of two times cosine of x minus
pi over the angle.

360
00:24:44 --> 00:24:50
This is a phi.
So, that's pi over four,

361
00:24:47 --> 00:24:53
minus pi over four.

362
00:24:49 --> 00:24:55

363
00:24:58 --> 00:25:04
Okay, all right,
now let's address the case

364
00:25:02 --> 00:25:08
which is going to occupy a lot
of the rest of today,

365
00:25:07 --> 00:25:13
and in a certain sense,
all of next time.

366
00:25:11 --> 00:25:17
What happens when p of alpha is
zero?

367
00:25:16 --> 00:25:22
Well, in order to be able to
handle this decently,

368
00:25:21 --> 00:25:27
it's necessary to have one more
formula, which is very slightly

369
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34
more complicated than the
substitution rule.

370
00:25:34 --> 00:25:40
But, it's the same kind of
rule.

371
00:25:36 --> 00:25:42
I'm going to call this,
or it is called the

372
00:25:38 --> 00:25:44
exponential.
So, I'm going to first prove a

373
00:25:41 --> 00:25:47
formula, which is the analog of
that, and then I will prove a

374
00:25:45 --> 00:25:51
green formula,
which is what to do here if p

375
00:25:48 --> 00:25:54
of alpha turns out to be zero.

376
00:25:51 --> 00:25:57
But, in order to be able to
prove that, we're going to be

377
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
the analog of the orange
formula.

378
00:25:56 --> 00:26:02
And, the analogue of the orange
formula, that tells you how to

379
00:26:00 --> 00:26:06
apply p of D to a
simple exponential.

380
00:26:05 --> 00:26:11
I need a formula which applies
p of D to that simple

381
00:26:11 --> 00:26:17
exponential times another
function.

382
00:26:14 --> 00:26:20
Now, I found I got into trouble
by continuing to call that

383
00:26:20 --> 00:26:26
alpha.
So, I'm now going to change the

384
00:26:24 --> 00:26:30
name of alpha to change alpha's
name to a.

385
00:26:30 --> 00:26:36
But, it's still complex.
I don't mean it's guaranteed to

386
00:26:34 --> 00:26:40
be complex.
I mean it's allowed to be

387
00:26:37 --> 00:26:43
complex.
So, a is now allowed to be a

388
00:26:40 --> 00:26:46
complex number.
I'm thinking of it,

389
00:26:43 --> 00:26:49
in general, as a complex
number, okay?

390
00:26:46 --> 00:26:52
I hope this doesn't upset you
too much, but you know,

391
00:26:51 --> 00:26:57
you change x to t's,
and y's to x's.

392
00:26:54 --> 00:27:00
This is no worse.
All right, what we going to do?

393
00:26:58 --> 00:27:04
Well, I'm going to use this
exponential shift rule,

394
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
I'll call it,
exponential shift rule or

395
00:27:06 --> 00:27:12
formula or law.
That's the substitution rule

396
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
for me.
So, this is going to be

397
00:27:13 --> 00:27:19
exponential shift law.
And, to apply,

398
00:27:17 --> 00:27:23
it tells you how to apply the
polynomial to not D,

399
00:27:21 --> 00:27:27
not just the exponential,
but the exponential times some

400
00:27:25 --> 00:27:31
function of x.
What's that?

401
00:27:28 --> 00:27:34
And now, the rule is very
simple.

402
00:27:32 --> 00:27:38
See, you can understand the
difficulty.

403
00:27:34 --> 00:27:40
If you try to start
differentiating,

404
00:27:37 --> 00:27:43
you're going to have to
calculate second derivatives of

405
00:27:40 --> 00:27:46
the stuff, and God forbid,
higher order equations.

406
00:27:44 --> 00:27:50
You would have to calculate
fourth derivatives,

407
00:27:47 --> 00:27:53
fifth derivatives.
You barely even want to

408
00:27:50 --> 00:27:56
calculate the first derivative.
That's okay.

409
00:27:53 --> 00:27:59
But, second derivative,
do I have to?

410
00:27:55 --> 00:28:01
No, not if you know the
exponential shift rule,

411
00:27:58 --> 00:28:04
which says you can get rid of
the e to the ax,

412
00:28:01 --> 00:28:07
make it pass to the left of the
operator where it's not in any

413
00:28:06 --> 00:28:12
position to do any harm any
longer, or upset the

414
00:28:09 --> 00:28:15
differentiation.
And, all you have to do is,

415
00:28:14 --> 00:28:20
when it passes over that
operator, it changes D to D plus

416
00:28:18 --> 00:28:24
a. So, the answer is,

417
00:28:21 --> 00:28:27
e to the ax.
There, it's passed over.

418
00:28:24 --> 00:28:30
But, when it did so,
it changed D to D plus a.

419
00:28:28 --> 00:28:34
And, what about the u?
Well, the u just stayed there.

420
00:28:32 --> 00:28:38
Nothing happened to it.
Okay, there's our orange

421
00:28:36 --> 00:28:42
formula.
I guess we better put the thing

422
00:28:40 --> 00:28:46
around the whole business.
Should I prove that,

423
00:28:43 --> 00:28:49
or the proof is quite easy.
So, let's do it just again to

424
00:28:48 --> 00:28:54
give you a chance to try to see,
now, if somebody gives you a

425
00:28:53 --> 00:28:59
formula like that,
you first stare at it.

426
00:28:56 --> 00:29:02
You might try a couple of
special cases,

427
00:28:59 --> 00:29:05
try it on a function and see if
it works, but already,

428
00:29:03 --> 00:29:09
you probably don't want to do
that.

429
00:29:08 --> 00:29:14
I mean, even if you took a
function like x here,

430
00:29:10 --> 00:29:16
you'd have to do a certain
amount of differentiating,

431
00:29:14 --> 00:29:20
and some quadratic thing here.
You'd calculate and calculate

432
00:29:17 --> 00:29:23
away for a little while,
and then if you did it

433
00:29:20 --> 00:29:26
correctly, the two would in fact
turn out to be equal.

434
00:29:23 --> 00:29:29
But, you would not necessarily
feel any the wiser.

435
00:29:26 --> 00:29:32
A better procedure in trying to
understand something like this

436
00:29:30 --> 00:29:36
is say, well,
let's keep the u general.

437
00:29:34 --> 00:29:40
Suppose we make D simple.
For example,

438
00:29:36 --> 00:29:42
well, if D is a constant,
of course there's nothing to

439
00:29:39 --> 00:29:45
happen because if this is just a
constant, both sides of these

440
00:29:43 --> 00:29:49
are the same.
This doesn't make any sense if

441
00:29:46 --> 00:29:52
p doesn't really have a D in it.
Well, what's the simplest

442
00:29:49 --> 00:29:55
polynomial which would have a D
in it?

443
00:29:52 --> 00:29:58
Well, D itself.
So, let's take a special case.

444
00:29:54 --> 00:30:00
p of D equals D,
and check the formula in that

445
00:29:58 --> 00:30:04
case; see if it works.
So, the formula is asking us,

446
00:30:03 --> 00:30:09
what is D, that's the p of D,
of e to the ax times u?

447
00:30:08 --> 00:30:14
I'm not going to put in the

448
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
variable here because it's just
a waste of chalk.

449
00:30:16 --> 00:30:22
Well, what is that?
I know how to calculate that.

450
00:30:21 --> 00:30:27
I'll use the product rule.
So, it's the derivative.

451
00:30:25 --> 00:30:31
I'll tell you what;
let's do the other order first.

452
00:30:30 --> 00:30:36
So, it's e to the ax times the
derivative of u plus the

453
00:30:35 --> 00:30:41
derivative of e to the ax,
which is a times e to the ax

454
00:30:40 --> 00:30:46
times u.

455
00:30:45 --> 00:30:51
Do you follow that?
This is the product rule.

456
00:30:48 --> 00:30:54
It's e to the ax times the
derivative of u plus the

457
00:30:51 --> 00:30:57
derivative of e to the ax,
which is this thing times u,

458
00:30:55 --> 00:31:01
the other factor.

459
00:30:58 --> 00:31:04
Now, is that right?
I want to make it look like

460
00:31:01 --> 00:31:07
that.
Well, to make it look like that

461
00:31:04 --> 00:31:10
I should first factor e to the
ax out.

462
00:31:07 --> 00:31:13
And now, what's left?
Well, if I factor e to the ax

463
00:31:11 --> 00:31:17
out, what's left is Du plus au,
which is exactly (D plus a)

464
00:31:15 --> 00:31:21
operating on u,
D u plus a u.

465
00:31:19 --> 00:31:25
Well, hey, that's just what the
formula said it should be.

466
00:31:23 --> 00:31:29
If you make e to the x pass
over D, it changes D to 

467
00:31:27 --> 00:31:33
D plus a.
Okay, now here's the main thing

468
00:31:32 --> 00:31:38
I want to show you.
All right, now,

469
00:31:34 --> 00:31:40
well let's try,
if this is true,

470
00:31:37 --> 00:31:43
also works out for D squared,
then the formula is

471
00:31:41 --> 00:31:47
clearly true by linearity
because an arbitrary p of D

472
00:31:45 --> 00:31:51
is just a linear
combination with constant

473
00:31:49 --> 00:31:55
coefficients of D,
D squared, and that constant

474
00:31:53 --> 00:31:59
thing, which we agreed there was
nothing to prove about.

475
00:31:57 --> 00:32:03
Now, hack, you're a hack if you
take D squared and start

476
00:32:01 --> 00:32:07
calculating the second
derivative of this.

477
00:32:06 --> 00:32:12
Okay, it's question about
hacks.

478
00:32:08 --> 00:32:14
I mean, it's just,
you haven't learned the right

479
00:32:12 --> 00:32:18
thing to do.
Okay, that will work,

480
00:32:14 --> 00:32:20
but it's not what you want to
do.

481
00:32:17 --> 00:32:23
Instead, you bootstrap your way
up.

482
00:32:20 --> 00:32:26
I have already a formula
telling me how to handle this.

483
00:32:24 --> 00:32:30
And, you can be anything.
Look at this not as D squared

484
00:32:28 --> 00:32:34
all by itself.
Calculate, instead,

485
00:32:32 --> 00:32:38
D squared e to the ax times u.

486
00:32:36 --> 00:32:42
Think of that as D,
the derivative of the

487
00:32:39 --> 00:32:45
derivative of e to the a x u.

488
00:32:42 --> 00:32:48
In other words,
we will do it one step at a

489
00:32:45 --> 00:32:51
time.
But you see now immediately the

490
00:32:48 --> 00:32:54
advantage of this.
What's D of e to the a x u?

491
00:32:51 --> 00:32:57
Well, I just calculated that.

492
00:32:55 --> 00:33:01
Now, don't go back to the
beginning.

493
00:32:57 --> 00:33:03
Don't go back to here.
Use the formula.

494
00:33:02 --> 00:33:08
After all, you worked to
calculate it,

495
00:33:04 --> 00:33:10
or I did.
So, it's D of,

496
00:33:06 --> 00:33:12
and what's this inside?
It's e to the ax times (D plus

497
00:33:10 --> 00:33:16
a) times u.
Well, that looks like a mess,

498
00:33:15 --> 00:33:21
but it isn't because I'm taking
D of e to the ax times

499
00:33:19 --> 00:33:25
something.
And I already know how to take

500
00:33:23 --> 00:33:29
D of e to the ax times
something.

501
00:33:25 --> 00:33:31
It doesn't matter what that
something is.

502
00:33:30 --> 00:33:36
Here, the something was u.
Here, the something is D plus

503
00:33:35 --> 00:33:41
(a times u) operating on u.
But, the principle is the same,

504
00:33:40 --> 00:33:46
and the answer is what?
Well, to take D of e to the ax

505
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
times something,
you pass the e to the ax over

506
00:33:50 --> 00:33:56
the D.
That changes D to D plus a.

507
00:33:53 --> 00:33:59
And, you apply that to the

508
00:33:57 --> 00:34:03
other guy, which is (D plus a)
applied to u.

509
00:34:03 --> 00:34:09
What's the answer?
e to the a x times (D plus a)

510
00:34:06 --> 00:34:12
squared u.

511
00:34:09 --> 00:34:15
It's just what you would have
gotten if you had taken e to the

512
00:34:14 --> 00:34:20
e to the x, pass it over,
and then changed D to D plus a.

513
00:34:18 --> 00:34:24
Now, another advantage to doing

514
00:34:22 --> 00:34:28
it this way is you can see that
this argument is going to

515
00:34:26 --> 00:34:32
generalize to D cubed.
In other words,

516
00:34:31 --> 00:34:37
you would continue on in the
same way by the process of

517
00:34:36 --> 00:34:42
mathematical,
one word, mathematical,

518
00:34:39 --> 00:34:45
begins with an I,
induction.

519
00:34:41 --> 00:34:47
By induction,
you would prove the same

520
00:34:44 --> 00:34:50
formula for the nth derivative.
If you don't know what

521
00:34:49 --> 00:34:55
mathematical induction is,
shame on you.

522
00:34:53 --> 00:34:59
But it's okay.
A lot of you will be able to go

523
00:34:57 --> 00:35:03
through life without ever having
to learn what it is.

524
00:35:03 --> 00:35:09
And, the rest of you will be
computer scientists.

525
00:35:08 --> 00:35:14
Okay, so that's the idea of
this rule.

526
00:35:13 --> 00:35:19
Now, we can use it to calculate
something.

527
00:35:18 --> 00:35:24
Let's see, I'm going to need
green for this,

528
00:35:23 --> 00:35:29
I guess, for our better
formula.

529
00:35:27 --> 00:35:33
The formula,
now, that tells you what to do

530
00:35:32 --> 00:35:38
if p of alpha is zero.

531
00:35:39 --> 00:35:45
So, we're trying to solve the
equation, D squared plus A D,

532
00:35:45 --> 00:35:51
we are trying to find a

533
00:35:49 --> 00:35:55
particular solution,
e to the ax,

534
00:35:54 --> 00:36:00
let's say.
Remember, a is complex.

535
00:35:58 --> 00:36:04
a could be complex.
It doesn't have to be real.

536
00:36:05 --> 00:36:11
But, the problem is that p of
alpha is zero.

537
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
How do I get a particular
solution?

538
00:36:12 --> 00:36:18
Well, I will write it down for
you.

539
00:36:14 --> 00:36:20
So, this is part of that
exponential input theorem.

540
00:36:18 --> 00:36:24
I think that's the way it is in
the notes.

541
00:36:21 --> 00:36:27
I gave all the cases together,
but I thought pedagogically

542
00:36:25 --> 00:36:31
it's probably a little better to
do the simplest case first,

543
00:36:30 --> 00:36:36
and then build up on the
complexity.

544
00:36:34 --> 00:36:40
So, what's yp?
The answer is yp is e to the a,

545
00:36:38 --> 00:36:44
except now you have to multiply

546
00:36:43 --> 00:36:49
it by x out front.
Where have you done something

547
00:36:48 --> 00:36:54
like that before?
Yes, don't tell me.

548
00:36:51 --> 00:36:57
I know you know.
But, what should go in the

549
00:36:56 --> 00:37:02
denominator?
Clearly not p of alpha.

550
00:36:59 --> 00:37:05
What goes in the denominator is

551
00:37:04 --> 00:37:10
the derivative.
Okay, but what if p prime of

552
00:37:09 --> 00:37:15
alpha is zero?
Couldn't that happen?

553
00:37:14 --> 00:37:20
Yes, it could happen.
So, we better make cases.

554
00:37:18 --> 00:37:24
This case is,
the case where this is okay

555
00:37:22 --> 00:37:28
corresponds to the case where
we're going to assume that alpha

556
00:37:27 --> 00:37:33
is a simple root,
is a simple root of the

557
00:37:31 --> 00:37:37
polynomial, p.
I don't know what to call the

558
00:37:35 --> 00:37:41
variable, p of D is okay.
A simple zero,

559
00:37:40 --> 00:37:46
in other words,
it's not double.

560
00:37:43 --> 00:37:49
Well, suppose is double.
One of the consequences you

561
00:37:48 --> 00:37:54
will see just in a second,
if it's a simple zero,

562
00:37:52 --> 00:37:58
that means this derivative is
not going to be zero.

563
00:37:57 --> 00:38:03
That's automatic.
Yeah, well, suppose it's not as

564
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
simple.
Well, suppose is a double root.

565
00:38:05 --> 00:38:11
How did a-- How did that get
changed to, argh!

566
00:38:11 --> 00:38:17
[LAUGHTER] That's not an alpha.
Oh, well, yes it is,

567
00:38:16 --> 00:38:22
obviously.
Change!

568
00:38:18 --> 00:38:24
All of you, I want you to
change.

569
00:38:21 --> 00:38:27
They should have something like
in a search key where

570
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
occurrences of alpha have been
changed to a with a stroke of a,

571
00:38:34 --> 00:38:40
just your thumb.
They don't have that for the

572
00:38:39 --> 00:38:45
blackboard, unfortunately.
Well, too bad,

573
00:38:42 --> 00:38:48
for the future.
Correctable blackboards.

574
00:38:46 --> 00:38:52
Well, what if a is double root?
It can't be more than a double

575
00:38:51 --> 00:38:57
root because you've only got a
quadratic polynomial.

576
00:38:55 --> 00:39:01
Quadratic polynomials only have
two roots.

577
00:39:00 --> 00:39:06
So, the worst that can happen
is that both of them are a.

578
00:39:04 --> 00:39:10
All right, in that case the
formula should be yp is equal

579
00:39:09 --> 00:39:15
to, you are now going to need x
squared up there times e 

580
00:39:14 --> 00:39:20
to the ax,
and in the denominator what you

581
00:39:18 --> 00:39:24
are going to need is the second
derivative of,

582
00:39:22 --> 00:39:28
evaluated at a.
Now, you can guess the way this

583
00:39:25 --> 00:39:31
going to go on.
For higher degree things,

584
00:39:29 --> 00:39:35
if you've got a triple root,
you will need here x cubed,

585
00:39:33 --> 00:39:39

586
00:39:37 --> 00:39:43
except you're going to need a
factorial there,

587
00:39:41 --> 00:39:47
too.
So, don't worry about it.

588
00:39:45 --> 00:39:51
It's in the notes,
but I'm not going to give you

589
00:39:49 --> 00:39:55
that for higher roots.
I don't even know if I will

590
00:39:53 --> 00:39:59
give it to you for double root.
Yes, I already did,

591
00:39:57 --> 00:40:03
so it's too late.
It's too late.

592
00:40:01 --> 00:40:07
Okay, so we will make this two
formulas according to whether a

593
00:40:06 --> 00:40:12
is a single or a double root.
Okay, let's prove one of these,

594
00:40:11 --> 00:40:17
and all of that will be good
enough for my conscience.

595
00:40:16 --> 00:40:22
Let's prove the first one.
Mostly, it's an exercise in

596
00:40:21 --> 00:40:27
using the first exponential
shift rule.

597
00:40:24 --> 00:40:30
Okay, this will be a first
example actually seeing a work

598
00:40:29 --> 00:40:35
in practice as opposed to
proving it.

599
00:40:34 --> 00:40:40
Okay, so what does that thing
look like?

600
00:40:37 --> 00:40:43
So, what does the polynomial
look like, which has a as a

601
00:40:42 --> 00:40:48
simple root?
So, we're going to try to prove

602
00:40:46 --> 00:40:52
the simple root case.
So, I'm just going to calculate

603
00:40:50 --> 00:40:56
what those guys actually look
like.

604
00:40:53 --> 00:40:59
What does p of D look
like if a is a simple root?

605
00:41:00 --> 00:41:06
Well, if it's a simple root,
that means it has a factor.

606
00:41:04 --> 00:41:10
When it factors,
it factors into the product of

607
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
(D minus a) times something
which isn't, D minus some other

608
00:41:13 --> 00:41:19
root.
And, the point is that b is not

609
00:41:16 --> 00:41:22
equal to A.
The roots are really distinct.

610
00:41:20 --> 00:41:26
Okay, what's,
then, p prime,

611
00:41:23 --> 00:41:29
I'm going to have to calculate
p prime of a.

612
00:41:27 --> 00:41:33
What is that?
Well, let's calculate p prime

613
00:41:32 --> 00:41:38
of D first.
It is, well,

614
00:41:34 --> 00:41:40
by the ordinary product rule,
it's the derivative of this

615
00:41:38 --> 00:41:44
times, which is one times (D
minus a) plus,

616
00:41:41 --> 00:41:47
that's one thing plus the same
thing on the other side,

617
00:41:45 --> 00:41:51
the derivative of this,
which is one times (D minus b).

618
00:41:49 --> 00:41:55
So, that's p prime.
And therefore,

619
00:41:51 --> 00:41:57
what's p prime of a?
It's nothing but,

620
00:41:55 --> 00:42:01
this part is zero,
and that's a minus b.

621
00:41:59 --> 00:42:05
Of course, this is not zero
because it's a simple root.

622
00:42:02 --> 00:42:08
And, that's the proof for you
if you want, that if the root is

623
00:42:06 --> 00:42:12
simple, that p prime of a
is guaranteed not to

624
00:42:10 --> 00:42:16
be zero.
And, you can see,

625
00:42:12 --> 00:42:18
it's going to be zero exactly
when b equals a,

626
00:42:15 --> 00:42:21
and that root occurs twice.
But, I'm assuming that didn't

627
00:42:19 --> 00:42:25
happen.
Okay, then all the rest we have

628
00:42:22 --> 00:42:28
to do is calculate,
do the calculation.

629
00:42:24 --> 00:42:30
So, what I want to prove now is
that with this p of D,

630
00:42:28 --> 00:42:34
what I'm trying to calculate
that p of D times that guy,

631
00:42:32 --> 00:42:38
x e to the a x,
except I'm going to

632
00:42:36 --> 00:42:42
write it as e to the a x times
x, guess why,

633
00:42:39 --> 00:42:45
divided by p prime of a.

634
00:42:44 --> 00:42:50
This is my proposed particular
solution.

635
00:42:47 --> 00:42:53
So, what I have to do is
calculate it,

636
00:42:50 --> 00:42:56
and see that it turns out to
be, what do I hope it turns out

637
00:42:54 --> 00:43:00
to be?
What the right hand side of the

638
00:42:57 --> 00:43:03
equation, the input?
The input is e to the ax.

639
00:43:01 --> 00:43:07
If this is true,

640
00:43:03 --> 00:43:09
then yp, a particular solution,
indeed, nothing will be a

641
00:43:07 --> 00:43:13
particular solution.
Of course, there could be

642
00:43:11 --> 00:43:17
others, but in this game,
I only have to find one

643
00:43:14 --> 00:43:20
particular solution,
and that certainly by far is

644
00:43:18 --> 00:43:24
the simple as one you could
possibly find.

645
00:43:21 --> 00:43:27
So, I have to calculate this.
And now, you see why I did the

646
00:43:25 --> 00:43:31
exponential shift rule because
this is begging to be

647
00:43:29 --> 00:43:35
differentiated by something
simpler than hack.

648
00:43:34 --> 00:43:40
Okay, you can also see why I
violated the natural order of

649
00:43:38 --> 00:43:44
things and put the e to the ax
on the left in order

650
00:43:43 --> 00:43:49
that it pass over more easily.
So, the answer on the left-hand

651
00:43:48 --> 00:43:54
side is e to the ax times p of
(D plus a).

652
00:43:51 --> 00:43:57
Now, what is (p of D) plus a?
Write it in this form.

653
00:43:56 --> 00:44:02
It's going to be a minus b.

654
00:44:00 --> 00:44:06
So, p of (D plus a)
is, change D to D plus a.

655
00:44:04 --> 00:44:10
So, the first factor is going

656
00:44:07 --> 00:44:13
to be D plus a minus b.

657
00:44:10 --> 00:44:16
And, what's the second factor?
Change D to D plus a.

658
00:44:15 --> 00:44:21
It turns into D.

659
00:44:16 --> 00:44:22
All this is the result of
taking that p of D,

660
00:44:21 --> 00:44:27
and changing D to D plus a.
And now, this is to be applied

661
00:44:25 --> 00:44:31
to what?
Well, e to the a x

662
00:44:28 --> 00:44:34
is already passed over.
So, what's left is x.

663
00:44:33 --> 00:44:39
And, that's to be divided by
the constant,

664
00:44:36 --> 00:44:42
p prime of a.
Now, what does this all come

665
00:44:41 --> 00:44:47
out to be?
e to the ax,

666
00:44:44 --> 00:44:50
what's D applied to x?
One, right?

667
00:44:48 --> 00:44:54
And now, what's this thing
applied to the constant one?

668
00:44:53 --> 00:44:59
Well, the D kills it,
so it has no effect.

669
00:44:57 --> 00:45:03
It makes it zero.
The rest just multiplies it by

670
00:45:02 --> 00:45:08
a minus b.
So, the answer to the top is (a

671
00:45:07 --> 00:45:13
minus b) times one.
And, the answer to the bottom

672
00:45:12 --> 00:45:18
is p prime of a,
which I showed you by just

673
00:45:17 --> 00:45:23
explicit calculation is a minus
b.

674
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
And so the answer is,
e to the a x comes

675
00:45:25 --> 00:45:31
out right.
Now, the other one,

676
00:45:29 --> 00:45:35
the other formula comes out the
same way.

677
00:45:31 --> 00:45:37
I'll leave that as an exercise.
Also, I don't dare do it

678
00:45:34 --> 00:45:40
because it's much too close to
the problem I asked you to do

679
00:45:38 --> 00:45:44
for homework.
So, let's by way of conclusion,

680
00:45:41 --> 00:45:47
I'll do one more simple
example, okay?

681
00:45:43 --> 00:45:49
And then, you can feel you
understand something.

682
00:45:46 --> 00:45:52
I'm sort of bothered that I
haven't done any examples of

683
00:45:49 --> 00:45:55
this more complicated case.
So, I'll pick an easy version

684
00:45:53 --> 00:45:59
instead of the one that you have
in your notes,

685
00:45:56 --> 00:46:02
which is the one you have for
homework, which is even easier.

686
00:46:01 --> 00:46:07
So, this one's epsilon less
easy.

687
00:46:04 --> 00:46:10
Y double prime minus 3 y prime
plus 2 y equals e to the x.

688
00:46:10 --> 00:46:16
Okay, notice that one is a

689
00:46:14 --> 00:46:20
simple root.
The one I'm talking about is

690
00:46:18 --> 00:46:24
the a here, which is one.
One is a simple root of the

691
00:46:23 --> 00:46:29
polynomial D squared minus 3D
plus two,

692
00:46:28 --> 00:46:34
isn't it?
It's a zero.

693
00:46:32 --> 00:46:38
Put D equal one and you get 
one minus three plus 

694
00:46:35 --> 00:46:41
two equals zero.
It's a simple root because

695
00:46:38 --> 00:46:44
anybody can see that one is not
a double root because you know

696
00:46:41 --> 00:46:47
from critical damping,
if one were a double root,

697
00:46:44 --> 00:46:50
you know just what the
polynomial would look like,

698
00:46:47 --> 00:46:53
and it wouldn't look like that
at all.

699
00:46:49 --> 00:46:55
It would not look like D
squared minus 3D plus two.

700
00:46:52 --> 00:46:58
It would look differently.

701
00:46:54 --> 00:47:00
Therefore, that proves that one
is a simple root.

702
00:46:57 --> 00:47:03
Okay, what's the particular
solution, therefore?

703
00:47:01 --> 00:47:07
The particular solution is x
times e to the x divided by the

704
00:47:06 --> 00:47:12
derivative, the derivative
evaluated at the point,

705
00:47:11 --> 00:47:17
so, what's p prime of D?
It is 2D minus three.

706
00:47:15 --> 00:47:21
If I evaluate it at the point,
one, it is negative one.

707
00:47:20 --> 00:47:26
So, if this is to be divided by
negative one,

708
00:47:25 --> 00:47:31
in other words,
it's minus x e to the X.

709
00:47:30 --> 00:47:36
And, if you don't believe it,
you could plug it in and check

710
00:47:35 --> 00:47:41
it out.
Okay, I'm letting you out one

711
00:47:39 --> 00:47:45
minute early.
Remember that.

712
00:47:41 --> 00:47:47
I'm trying to pay off the
accumulated debt.
