00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,664

2
00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:07,250
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,390
Welcome back.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,160
So today, we're going to take
a look at some forced

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,150
oscillators and the exponential
response formula.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,630
And the problem we're going to
take a look at is first, for

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,570
part one, to consider the
equation x dot dot plus 8x

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,060
equals, and then a forcing term
on the right-hand side,

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,690
cosine omega t.

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,700
And we're going to consider the
case when omega squared is

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,010
not equal to 8.

12
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,900
So in the language
of resonance,

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,470
we're not on resonance.

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,800
And we're also asked why is this
called an undamped forced

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,170
oscillator.

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,520
And then for part two, to
use the ERF to solve the

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,600
differential equation x dot
dot plus 2x plus 4x

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,330
equals cosine 3t.

19
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,380
And then, what is the natural
angular frequency of this

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,420
differential equation?

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,310
So I'll let you take a look at
these problems and try them

22
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,130
out for yourself.

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,380
And I'll be back in a moment.

24
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:09,487

25
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,000
Hi everyone.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
Welcome back.

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,000
So we're asked to find the
general solution to the

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,210
differential equation, x
dot, dot plus 8x equals

29
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,120
cosine omega t.

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,150

31
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,320
And notice how this is a
differential equation with

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,760
constant coefficients.

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,800
But it's being forced by a
periodic function on the

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,230
right-hand side.

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,180
So the first thing to
do is to write down

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,850
the homogeneous solution.

37
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,910

38
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,880
So the homogeneous solution,
which I'll denote with a

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,770
subscript h, solves the
differential equation with the

40
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,420
right-hand side of 0.

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:05,500
This gives us a characteristic
polynomial of s squared plus 8

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,930
equals 0, which then gives
us roots of plus

43
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,100
or minus root 8i.

44
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,300

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:23,870
So the homogeneous solution
is some constant C1.

46
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,670
And when we have purely
imaginary roots, we have

47
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:35,940
cosine of the imaginary term
times t plus some constant C2

48
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,540
times sine of the imaginary
term, which in this

49
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,790
case is root 8t.

50
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,020

51
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,800
So the homogeneous solution is
always contains two constants.

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,350
And it's solves the differential
equation with a

53
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,720
zero right-hand side.

54
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,990
The general solution, however,
is the homogeneous solution

55
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,060
plus one particular solution
that solves the differential

56
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,970
equation, 8 dot, dot plus 8x
equals cosine omega t.

57
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,260
So we just need to find
one solution to this

58
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,510
differential equation.

59
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,670

60
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,080
And in this case, I'll use the
exponential response formula.

61
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,090
But first note that when we use
the exponential response

62
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,380
formula, we need a forcing to be
of the form e to st on the

63
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,620
right-hand side.

64
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,740
And cosine omega t is
not in that form.

65
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:35,850
However, what we can do is
there's a trick to complexify

66
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,680
the right-hand side.

67
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,920
So we know that the cosine omega
t is actually the real

68
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,970
part of i omega t.

69
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,650

70
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:53,910
So what this means is if we have
a complex solution, zed,

71
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,790
which solves zed dot, dot plus
8 zed equals e to the i omega

72
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:12,490
t, then we can take x equals
the real part of zed, then

73
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:22,260
solves the differential equation
8 dot, dot plus 8x

74
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,630
equals the real part of
the right-hand side,

75
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,880
cosine omega t.

76
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,620

77
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,710
And now we're in business
because this equation has the

78
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,300
form where we can use the
exponential response formula.

79
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,970
So solving this differential
equation for zed, we have a

80
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,090
particular solution for zed,
is going to be e to the i

81
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,450
omega t divided by the
characteristic polynomial

82
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,130
evaluated at the exponential.

83
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,540
So in this case, the exponential
is i omega.

84
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,960
So we must evaluate the
polynomial at i omega.

85
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,640
And this is the solution
provided that the polynomial

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,470
evaluated at i omega
doesn't vanish.

87
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,530
And in our case, the
characteristic polynomial, p

88
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:22,020
of s, we worked out already
to be s squared plus 8.

89
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,530
So this gives us a particular
solution for zed, which is 1

90
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:35,730
divided by I omega squared plus
8 on the denominator.

91
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,720
We have e to i omega
on the numerator.

92
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,160

93
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,150
And of course, 1 over i omega
squared plus 8 becomes 1 over

94
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,400
8 minus omega squared.

95
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,880

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,600
And we know we don't have a
problem because omega, we were

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,380
told in the problem, is not
equal to the square root of 8.

98
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,520
So in this case, we know
that the denominator is

99
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,570
not going to vanish.

100
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,800
And now what we need to do is
just take x for the particular

101
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:21,320
solution to be the real part of
zed, which is going to be

102
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,710
the real part.

103
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,490
I'll write it out.

104
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:41,950
8 minus omega squared cosine
omega t plus i sine omega t,

105
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:49,580
which gives us 1 over 8 minus
omega squared cosine omega t.

106
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:56,060

107
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,800
So the total solution, the
general solution, is going to

108
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,740
be the sum of the homogeneous
solution plus

109
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,990
the particular solution.

110
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,160

111
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,200
And in our case, that's going
to be C1 cosine omega t plus

112
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:29,170
C2 sine omega t plus 1 over
8 minus omega squared

113
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,360
cosine omega t.

114
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,600
Sorry.

115
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,850
These should be root 8's.

116
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,600

117
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,210
So this is the homogeneous
part.

118
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,395

119
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:46,110
And this is the particular
solution.

120
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,850

121
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,520
And this is the general
solution.

122
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,450
So we were asked, also, why this
is sometimes called an

123
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,750
undamped forced oscillator.

124
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,360
Well, it's undamped, because in
the differential equation,

125
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,910
there is no damping term.

126
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,870
There's no term proportional
to x dot.

127
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,710
And then, secondly, it's forced
because we have a

128
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,900
forcing on the right-hand
side.

129
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,610
We have an input function, f,
which in this case is cosine

130
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,200
omega t which doesn't
depend on x.

131
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,420
And that forces the differential
equation.

132
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,740
Also note that the forcing term
gives rise to part of the

133
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:28,130
solution which is directly
proportional to the forcing.

134
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,000
In fact, it has the
same frequency

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,110
but a different amplitude.

136
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,090
So this concludes part A.

137
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:48,020
Now for part B, we're asked to
use the ERF to solve the

138
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:58,470
differential equation x dot,
dot plus 2x dot plus 4x

139
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,740
equals cosine 3t.

140
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,950

141
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,090
And again, we can use
the same trick.

142
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:15,510
The right-hand side isn't of
the form e to the i3t.

143
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:21,660
But what we can do is we can
write cosine 3t as the real

144
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:28,490
part of e to the i3t, and then
solve the differential

145
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:38,120
equation, zed dot, dot plus 2
zed dot plus 4 zed equals e to

146
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:45,210
the i3t, and then take x equals
the real part of zed.

147
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,710
And in this case, we're only
looking for a particular

148
00:09:47,710 --> 00:10:00,130
solution, which we can compute
using the ERF.

149
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,420
So it's 1 over the
characteristic polynomial

150
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,480
evaluated at 3i times
e to the i3t.

151
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,390
And what's a characteristic
polynomial of this

152
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,556
differential equation?

153
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:21,680
Well, p of s is going to be s
squared plus 2s plus 4, which

154
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:31,110
means that p of 3i is going to
be 3i squared plus 2 times 3i

155
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:36,140
plus 4, which gives us
negative 9 plus 4 is

156
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,370
negative 5 plus 6i.

157
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,740

158
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,790
And putting the pieces together,
we end up getting

159
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:52,670
that x is equal to the real part
of 1 over negative 5 plus

160
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,720
6i e to the i3t.

161
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:06,510

162
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,510
And we can expand out the
numerator using Euler's

163
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,350
formula to get cosine
3t plus i sine 3t.

164
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:22,360
And when the dust settles,
I got 1 over 61--

165
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,610
let me check my notes--

166
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,470

167
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:35,480
minus 5 cosine 3t
plus 6 sine 3t.

168
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,240

169
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,250
So I'll let you work at this
last step for yourself.

170
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,460

171
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,970
And then, lastly, what is the
natural angular frequency of

172
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,700
the differential equation?

173
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,530
Well, this is just
some notation.

174
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,010
We sometimes call the natural
angular frequency to be the

175
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,830
square root of the term
proportional to x.

176
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,230
So in this case, the term
two here comes in

177
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,130
as a damping term.

178
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:08,200
The natural frequency, which is
sometimes written as omega

179
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,820
naught squared, is always
equal to this

180
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,300
term, which is 4.

181
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,210
So the natural frequency, the
natural angular frequency,

182
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,270
omega naught, would be
the square root of 4,

183
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,520
which would be 2.

184
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,770

185
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,380
So I just like to
quickly recap.

186
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,810
We've taken a look at
forced oscillators.

187
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,530
And we computed their solutions
using the ERF.

188
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,830
And one common trend,
particularly when we have an

189
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,500
oscillating input, a forcing
term, is to first change the

190
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,400
oscillating term into a complex
exponential, then

191
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,800
compute a particular solution
using the ERF formula, and

192
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,290
then take the real part of the
ERF solution to recover a real

193
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,130
solution to the ODE.

194
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,220
That gives us the particular
solution.

195
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,520
And then, in some cases,
we also have to add the

196
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,720
homogeneous solution to it to
get the full general solution

197
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,260
to the ODE.

198
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,800
So I like to conclude here.

199
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,050
And I'll see you next time.

200
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,980
