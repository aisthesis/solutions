00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,170
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,380
Welcome back.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,140
So today, I'd like to tackle
a problem in undetermined

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,000
coefficients, specifically find
a particular solution to

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,020
each of the following equations
using undetermined

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,220
coefficients.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,000
So for part A, we have x
dot plus 3x equals t

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
squared plus t.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,960
And for B, we have x
dot, dot plus x dot

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,860
equals t to the four.

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,440
So I'll let you work
this problem.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,690
And I'll come back
in a minute.

14
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:42,386

15
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:43,490
Hi Everyone.

16
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,570
Welcome back.

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,910
So we're asked to solve this
problem using the method of

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,520
undetermined coefficients.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,990
And specifically, the
observation is if we have a

20
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,530
differential equation with
constant coefficients, and we

21
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,160
have a forcing on the right-hand
side which is a

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,560
polynomial, then there's
always going to be a

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,959
particular solution, which is
a polynomial, that has the

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:12,940
form of some constant times
t to the power of r plus

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:21,735
constant tr minus 1 plus a
constant C or minus 2tr minus

26
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:31,100
2 plus dot, dot, dot plus C1t
and then possibly plus C0.

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,650
And typically, the problem is to
find out what's the highest

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,310
order polynomial that
we should guess.

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,820
These constant C's, they're
referred to as the

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,840
undetermined coefficients.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,500
And these are the constants
that we seek to solve.

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,570
So for our first differential
equation, we have x dot plus

33
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:59,040
3x equals t squared plus t.

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,660
And the power that we should
guess for a solution are, it's

35
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,240
always going to be at least as
high as the highest power on

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,400
the right-hand side.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,080
So the right-hand side tells us
at least the largest that

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,030
we should at least start
our guess at.

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,650
And then, sometimes, we have
to knock it up a few orders

40
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,570
depending on what the lowest
order derivative on the

41
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,470
left-hand side is.

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,940
So in this case, the term on the
left-hand side, there's no

43
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,860
derivative term.

44
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,120
And so what we can do for this
case is we can just take r is

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,780
equal to 2, the power
of the polynomial on

46
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,120
the right-hand side.

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,100
So we're going to seek a guess
or an ansatz, which is some

48
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:47,250
constant A times t squared
plus B times t plus some

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,890
constant C. And again, I've
taken the highest polynomial

50
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,810
that we should guess to be 2,
because the right-hand side is

51
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,270
2 in this case.

52
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,840
So now what we do is we just
substitute this in into the

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,620
differential equation.

54
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,000
And we choose our
A, B, and C to

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,420
construct this as a solution.

56
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,410
So let's go ahead and do that.

57
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:17,400
So taking its derivative, we
have 2At plus B. And then, we

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,960
have 3 times At squared plus Bt
plus C. And we want this to

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,360
be equal to t squared plus t.

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
And now, the only way that the
left-hand side is going to

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,910
equal the right-hand side is if
the coefficients in front

62
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,420
of each polynomial
are the same.

63
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,060
So in the left-hand side, we
only have one term that has a

64
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,660
t squared in it.

65
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,910
And that must, therefore, equal
the t squared term on

66
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,810
the right-hand side.

67
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,410
So these two terms have to
be equal to each other.

68
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,770
So we end up getting that
3A has to be equal 1.

69
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,330
And so A is equal
to one third.

70
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,060

71
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,600
And now what we do is
we collect terms

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,000
with a power of t.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,240
This gives us 3B plus 2A on the
left-hand side, so that's

74
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,300
this term and this term.

75
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,470
And we want that t equal t on
the right-hand side or just 1.

76
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,450
Now, we already know that
A is equal to one third.

77
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:34,770
So we end up getting that 3B is
equal to 1 minus 2/3, which

78
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,880
is equal to one third.

79
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,360
Put 3B as one third, which
means that B is

80
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,610
equal to one ninth.

81
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,800

82
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,420
And now lastly, to determine
C, we see that B

83
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,410
plus 3C must be 0.

84
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:03,700
So B plus 3C is 0, or C is
equal to negative 1/27.

85
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,660
So notice how we always start
with the highest power.

86
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,640
In this case, A is
the coefficient

87
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,420
in front of t squared.

88
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,570
That lets us solve for A.
And then the rest of the

89
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,150
undetermined coefficients, we
can solve for, almost like a

90
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,400
giant zipper.

91
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,000

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,740
So the particular solution that
we just constructed, when

93
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:36,400
the dust settles is one third
t squared plus one ninth t

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,190
minus 1/27.

95
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,770
So this concludes part A.

96
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,797
For part b, we have the
differential equation, x dot

97
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:54,021
dot plus x dot equals
t to the four.

98
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,670

99
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,360
And in this case, we know
that the right-hand side

100
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,080
is a power of four.

101
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,840
So we should guess at least
a fourth order polynomial.

102
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,290
However, we see that there's
no constant multiple of x.

103
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,440
In fact, the lowest order
derivative is 1.

104
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,070
So what this means is we should
actually knock the

105
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,040
solution that we guess up
one order polynomial.

106
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,470
So we should try and guess x
is equal to At to the fifth

107
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:34,540
plus B t to the four plus Ct
cubed plus Dt squared plus Et.

108
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,340
And we can leave
out an F term.

109
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,100
We can leave out a constant.

110
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,660
Because if we just substitute
that in the left-hand side, we

111
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,750
see that the x dot, dot is going
to vanish, and x dot is

112
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,650
going to vanish.

113
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,960
So we can omit any
constant term.

114
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,530
So let's seek this ansatz,
and plug it into the

115
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,520
differential equation.

116
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,050
And if we do that, we
get 20At cubed.

117
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,400
And this is plugging into
the x dot dot term.

118
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:21,190
This term is going to give us 12
Bt squared plus 6Ct plus D.

119
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,600
And then the x dot term is going
to give us 5At to the

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:49,290
four plus 4 Bt cubed plus 3Ct
squared plus 2Dt plus E.

121
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,840
And we want the sum of
these two terms to

122
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,870
equal t to the four.

123
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,210

124
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,190
So again, what we do is we start
with the highest power.

125
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,260
We see that on the left-hand
side, we have 5A must be

126
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,380
equated with just 1.

127
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,665
So we have 5A is equal to 1,
or A is equal to one fifth.

128
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:15,990

129
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:26,070
Secondly, we're going to have
20A plus 4B equals the 0

130
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:31,380
polynomial, or the 0 which is
the coefficient of t cubed.

131
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,270
And this gives us B is equal
to negative 5A, which is

132
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,520
negative 1.

133
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,309

134
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,090
And now for the quadratic
terms, we have

135
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,150
12B plus 3C is 0.

136
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,400
So C is going to equal negative
4B, which is negative

137
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,570
4 times negative 1, which
just gives us 4.

138
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,890

139
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:15,500
The linear term is going to give
us 6C plus 2D equals 0,

140
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,390
which gives us D is equal to
negative 3C, which gives us

141
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,880
negative 12.

142
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:31,790
And then the last term is D plus
E is 0, which gives us E

143
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,190
is equal to 12.

144
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,500
So at the end of the day, we
end up with a particular

145
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:45,110
solution, which is a polynomial
of one fifth t to

146
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:54,760
the five minus 2 to the four
plus C, which is 4t cubed plus

147
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,760
D, which is negative
12t squared plus E,

148
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,870
which is 12 times t.

149
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,130
And by construction, this
polynomial solves the

150
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,200
differential equation with a
forcing of t to the four on

151
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,610
the right-hand side.

152
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,380
So just to recap, when we're
faced with an undetermined

153
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,540
coefficient problem, what we
have to do is we just guess a

154
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,880
solution, which is
a polynomial.

155
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,100
And the main difficulty is
just guessing the highest

156
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
power of the polynomial.

157
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,430
And that's always going to
be at least as big as the

158
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,420
polynomial on the
right-hand side.

159
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,050
But as we saw in part B, we
sometimes have to knock it up

160
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,570
a few orders depending on what
the differential equation

161
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,610
actually is.

162
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,940
So I'd like to conclude here.

163
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,190
And I'll see you next time.

164
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,240
