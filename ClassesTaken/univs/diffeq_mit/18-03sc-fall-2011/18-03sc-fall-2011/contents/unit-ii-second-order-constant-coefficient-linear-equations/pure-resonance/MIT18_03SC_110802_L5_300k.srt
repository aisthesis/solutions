00:00:05,335 --> 00:00:09,090
PROFESSOR: Welcome to this
recitation on pure resonance.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,140
So here we're given an operator
pd equals d squared

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,480
plus 4i, where d is the
differential operator and i is

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,970
the identity operator.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,620
And you're asked to consider the
equation pd applied to x

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,850
equals f0 cos omega t, where
f0 is a constant.

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,470
So the first question is what
is the natural frequency of

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,770
the system.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,170
The second one is to use the
exponential response formula

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,070
to solve for pd x equals
f0 cos omega t.

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,370
And here you need to be careful
and do it for both

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,560
cases omega equal to 2 and omega
equals not equal to 2.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,110
And the last question is just
to sketch the graph for the

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,360
response of this system pd
x equals cos 2t, with the

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,950
initial conditions x of 0 and
x dot of 0 equals to 0,

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,700
basically, rest initial
conditions.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,100
So why don't you pause the
video, take a few minutes, and

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,350
work through this problem.

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:09,350

21
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,270
Welcome back.

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,880
So first what is the natural
frequency of this system?

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,210
So let's just rewrite
our system here.

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,870
This is the left-hand side.

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,460

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,662
So basically, this just gives us
an x dot dot plus 4x on the

27
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:32,810
left-hand side.

28
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,080
So the system that we're solving
is simply x dot dot

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,520
plus 4x equals f0 cos omega t.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,840
So the first question asks us
for the natural frequency of

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,830
this system.

32
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,500
The natural frequency of this
system can be found regardless

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,950
of what you have the right-hand
side, just by

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,580
looking at the characteristic
polynomial of your equation.

35
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,380
The characteristic polynomial
here would be s

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,750
squared plus 4.

37
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,410
When this characteristic
polynomial is equal to 0, we

38
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,380
can solve for s and find what
are the natural frequencies of

39
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,340
the system, if basically we get
complex solutions, which

40
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,590
is the case here.

41
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,280

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,770
Gives us a square
equal minus 4.

43
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,380
So s equals plus or minus i2.

44
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,240
So the natural frequency of
our system would be omega

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,670
equals 2, because we only
consider frequencies that are

46
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,920
positive here.

47
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,700

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,950
Second part.

49
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,260
Now, we're asked to look at
the full system with the

50
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,100
forcing on the right-hand
side.

51
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:59,310
And using the exponential
response formula, find one

52
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,780
solution to this system.

53
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,190
So here we're talking about a
particular solution with the

54
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,410
exponential response formula.

55
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,170
So what does the ERF tell us?

56
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,170
The ERF, if you recall here, the
base of it for this system

57
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:21,880
for example, is the fact that
cosine is the real part of the

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,080
exponential i omega t.

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,300
So we can rewrite this whole
equation as x dot dot plus 4x

60
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,000
equals f0 exponential
i omega t.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,120
And we would get then a
particular solution, if I

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,120
ignore any particular value of
omega at this point, which

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,570
would have the form of the
amplitude that we have on the

64
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,030
right-hand side at 0,
exponential omega t, which is

65
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,360
basically our forcing, over the
characteristic polynomial

66
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,955
of the equation.

67
00:03:52,955 --> 00:04:00,370
So s squared plus 4, evaluated
at the frequence here that

68
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,140
would appear at the forcing in
the exponential form, so with

69
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,390
the i omega t.

70
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,950

71
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,110
So here you can see right away
that we would have a problem.

72
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,630
If you were using this formula,
if i omega t was a

73
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,180
pole or basically a 0, to this
characteristic polynomial.

74
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,140
And so that's why you were asked
to be careful with the

75
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,140
value of omega equals to
2 or not equal to 2.

76
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,400
So here let's consider omega not
equal to 2, so that I can

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,240
actually write down 1 over p i
omega, because we know that p

78
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,440
i2 is equal to 0.

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,240
So if omega is not equal to 2,
were out of the danger zone.

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,300
And from this point, we can
just basically plug in our

81
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:50,830
values, i omega t, and p i omega
would just give us 4

82
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,080
minus omega squared.

83
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,640

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,290
So here again, that omega
equals 2 danger zone

85
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,620
approaches, where we would be
dividing by 0 if we didn't

86
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,761
take the constraint omega
not equal to 0.

87
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:08,120
So this is the complex form of
this particular solution.

88
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,230
But we're dealing with a real
value problem, so we want to

89
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:18,970
take the real part of this to
have the solution to the

90
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,080
problem we were given.

91
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,980
And so that would just give us
f0 4 minus omega squared

92
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:33,000
cosine omega t.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,810
So now let's take the case
omega equals to 2.

94
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,910
OK So what happens?

95
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,870
If omega equals to 2, this
formula that you're given

96
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,900
fails, and you need to seek
for the derivative of the

97
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,730
characteristic polynomial.

98
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:56,520
And we basically have
2i equals to 2.

99
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,780
So what about p prime of 2i?

100
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,550

101
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,220
So p prime of s is simply 2s.

102
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:17,810
So if we evaluate p prime at 2i,
we simply have 4i, which

103
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,210
is not equal to 0.

104
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,320
So at this point we can use
the resonant exponential

105
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,790
response formula that you saw.

106
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,880

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,540
Just change my chalk.

108
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,280
We're here.

109
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,280
We would again, same trick, the
cosine is just the real

110
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,630
part of the exponential.

111
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,430
So we can use this formula.

112
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:49,760
And we have now to introduce a
t f0 exponential i omega t,

113
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,580
because we're solving here for
the complex value equation.

114
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,280
And now we can divide by the
p prime evaluated at

115
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,150
2i, which is 4i.

116
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,090
And so basically, I
can end up with a

117
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,410
minus i at the numerator.

118
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,370
So to take now the real value
solution, we need again to

119
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,530
take the real part of zp.

120
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,830
So here now we have an i, so
we need to be careful.

121
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,180
We're going to have
solution in sine.

122
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,600
So let me just write
down what know.

123
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,650
t f0 over 4.

124
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,980
This with the Euler formula
would be cosine plus i sine.

125
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,420
The i sine would be multiplying
this i, the 2

126
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,590
minus would cancel out.

127
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:35,590
And so we would end up with
sine omega t, t f0 over 4.

128
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,330
And this would then give
us the solution.

129
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,310
And here, note that I actually
chose the value omega equals

130
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,600
to 2, so we can even
be more explicit.

131
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,856
For this case, we actually
have omega equals to 2t.

132
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:53,260

133
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,220
So the last part of the problem
was to sketch the

134
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:11,891
solution for the initial
conditions, x of 0 or x dot of

135
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:16,350
0 equal to 0, so the rest
initial conditions.

136
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,090
So here are two ways
to proceed.

137
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,380
The long way would be to seek
the solution to the

138
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,550
homogeneous equation without
the right-hand side, the

139
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,100
forcing cosine, introduced two
constants of integration, and

140
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,170
then seek these constants
of integration

141
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,490
on the general solution.

142
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,390
And you would find that these
two constants of integration

143
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,570
would be 0 with these
initial conditions.

144
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,120
The other fast way to test your
particular solution and

145
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,280
verify that it actually does
satisfy the initial conditions

146
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,100
that you were given, and so you
can then write away the

147
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:58,310
solution as being
simply sine 2t.

148
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:04,140
Here you can see that at 0, we
would have basically a 0.

149
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,910
And then if you do a
differentiation, you just need

150
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,020
to be careful here, because you
have a product function,

151
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,480
and you end up also with a 0.

152
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,260
So this actually is our general
solution for this

153
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,630
particular initial condition,
And to sketch

154
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,050
this, we can grow.

155
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,860
So here if I just pick f0 equal
to 1, I'm just going to

156
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:33,620
do t/4 for the envelopes.

157
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,410
At t equals 0, we
start with 0.

158
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:46,850
And we know that we're going to
have the first extrema at

159
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,070
p/4 and the first 0 at pi/2.

160
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:58,950
And so basically, we end up
with something like that.

161
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:04,680
So basically, it's sine of
circular frequency 2, and with

162
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,410
an envelope prescribed by t/4.

163
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,410
Or if we had another value
at 0, it would be f0 t/4.

164
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,420
So the oscillation is ongoing as
t goes to infinity with an

165
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,620
envelope that diverges
to infinity.

166
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,690
So this is basically a solution
that would not be

167
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,010
convergent to 0.

168
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,790
So this ends this recitation.

169
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,000
And before I finish, I just
want to point out that the

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,100
fact that it diverges is due
to the fact that we are

171
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,940
forcing this system very close
to its natural frequency.

172
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,140
And so this is a typical
phenomenon that you can

173
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,250
associate with a resonance,
because we're basically

174
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,400
forcing a system close to
its natural frequency.

175
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,280
So it's having this huge
amplification in the response.

176
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,200
And that's what these increasing
envelopes mean.

177
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,920
So this ends this recitation.

178
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,520
And the key here was to realize
how to use your

179
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,600
exponential response formula,
how to move on to use the

180
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,950
resonance exponential response
formula by testing for the

181
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,170
first order derivative.

182
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,820
And if that test failed,
you would be

183
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,290
going to higher orders.

184
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,010
And then, given an initial
condition, how to basically

185
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,080
sketch the function and have a
physical understanding of what

186
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,500
the resonance means.

187
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,750
That ends this recitation.

188
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,290
