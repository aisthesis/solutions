00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,258

2
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:06,820
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,010
So in this session we're going
to cover homogeneous constant

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,450
coefficient equations
for any roots.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,930
So we're told to assume that z
of t is equal to exponential

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,960
minus 3t times cosine
plus i of sine t.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,600
And to assume that this complex
number is a solution

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,980
to this differential equation,
which is second order with

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,530
constant coefficients m, b,
and k, which are real, and

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,830
from this assumption
give two real

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,620
solutions to this equation.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,120
In the second part, we're
asked to find a general

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,770
solution for this other
differential equation, which

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,440
is the same form as that seen
in part a, with now the real

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,220
values for b equals to
6, m equals to 1,

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,410
and k equals to 10.

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,630
And then we're asked of this
system that would be captured

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,510
by this differential equation is
overdamped or underdamped.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,660
In the last part we switch gears
and we're given a series

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,560
of roots, eight roots to an
eighth degree polynomial, and

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,040
we're asked to write down the
general solution for that

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
polynomial.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,800
Note that here we have repeated
roots, which is

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,240
basically where the trick is.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,980
So why don't you take a few
minutes, and we'll come back

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:31,710
to solve these problems.

27
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,900
Welcome back.

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,920
So for the first part, we're
given a complex number clearly

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:46,301
split into its real part
and its imaginary part.

30
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:49,250

31
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,605
So this is the imaginary
part z, and this is the

32
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:56,080
real part of z.

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,260

34
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,220
Now, the differential equation
that we are given is constant

35
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,139
value, differential equation
second order, linear, and

36
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,870
homogeneous.

37
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,550
So there is no right-hand
side.

38
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,690
So clearly you can see that if
a complex number that can be

39
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,290
written as real part plus i
imaginary part is a solution

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,380
to this equation, then both
sides independently are also

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,050
solutions to this equation.

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,250
So by giving us this complex
number, we are actually given

43
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,460
two types of solutions that we
can then write down as two

44
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,450
linearly independent
solutions.

45
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,280
So the general solution to this
differential equation can

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,960
then be written in the form of
one constant coefficient is

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:52,960
undetermined, minus 3t cos
t plus another constant

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,440
coefficient minus
3t sine of t.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,710
Where basically, we're
introducing linear combination

50
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,670
of two linearly independent
solutions that were just taken

51
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,040
from the original complex
number we were given.

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,330
So for the second part now, we
are asked to find a general

53
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,750
solution for the ODE.

54
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,660
We'll just rewrite
here for now.

55
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,690
So again, constant

56
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,050
coefficient, homogeneous equation.

57
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,080
And we're just asked to find
a general solution.

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,690
So we learned from the class
notes that we can use the

59
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,080
characteristic polynomial method
to solve this equation.

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,010
And the characteristic
polynomial here

61
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,260
will have this form.

62
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,330

63
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,810
And basically, we just need
to find the roots of this

64
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,360
characteristic polynomial to
be able then to express the

65
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,140
solutions of this homogeneous
constant coefficient equation

66
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,460
in terms of function,
exponential to whatever routes

67
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,900
we will find.

68
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,130
So I just want to write down
the discriminant of this

69
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,340
polynomial.

70
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,510
So what do we have here?

71
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,500
What was the question again?

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,860
So we're asked then
to just find the

73
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,579
discriminant for this equation.

74
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:26,590
So b squared minus 4t, which
is basically minus 4.

75
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,535
So we have a discriminant
that is negative.

76
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:33,510

77
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:40,960
And the roots for our polynomial
here are just going

78
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:51,690
to be the roots absolute value
of the discriminant with the

79
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,580
complex number i out, because
we had a negative

80
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,720
discriminant.

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,470
So these couple of solutions,
plus or minus, tell us that we

82
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,330
are going to have oscillations
as solutions for this

83
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,270
differential equation, and that
it's also going to be

84
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,770
actually damped oscillations,
because we have first the real

85
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,220
part of the number
being negative.

86
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:19,909
So let me just write down the
pair of solutions that we

87
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:27,120
would have. We will have this
that comes out of the real

88
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,110
part, cosine.

89
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,410
I'll put the root
of 4 is just 2.

90
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,460
And so we have cosine
t, that's 1.

91
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,110

92
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,810
6/2, of course, is just 3.

93
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:55,240

94
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,820
So here I switched directly to
writing them in cosine and

95
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,650
sine in the forms. But we could
also have kept it in the

96
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,170
complex form if we were solving
the equation in

97
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,360
complex space.

98
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,750
And then we would just have
complex exponentials here with

99
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,990
the frequencies omega,
angular frequency 1.

100
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,200
So this is the homogeneous
equation, the homogeneous

101
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,250
solution for this homogeneous
constant coefficient

102
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,680
differential equation.

103
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,940
Now, what do we see?

104
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,560
We can see that it's exactly
the same form that the

105
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
solution that we
had previously.

106
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,610
And so the question here is this
oscillator overdamped or

107
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,680
underdamped?

108
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,550
And as we see here, we're going
to have oscillations

109
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,830
that are damped by a pre-factor
of decaying

110
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,730
exponential minus 3t
for both cases.

111
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,890
So this is decaying.

112
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,300
So there is definitely
damping.

113
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,570
And we can see that here,
because we had a positive

114
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,410
value for b, which is
the damping term in

115
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,070
the oscillator system.

116
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,020
But there are still
oscillations, because we had a

117
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,110
discriminant that was negative,
which introduces

118
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,820
complex numbers, hence cosines
and sines, so basically,

119
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,920
oscillations.

120
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,600
Therefore we're in the case of
an underdamped response, an

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,850
underdamped system.

122
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:27,120

123
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,580
The discriminant was negative.

124
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:42,290
So for the last part of this
problem, we now leave this

125
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,960
differential equation, which was
second order, and move to

126
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,470
higher order differential
equations of eighth order.

127
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,460
And we're given eight roots.

128
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,270

129
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,024
4 minus 5i.

130
00:07:57,024 --> 00:08:00,620

131
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,750
We have the root of 3, which
is real, which is repeated

132
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,030
three times, and a root 4 plus
or minus 5i, which is

133
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,460
repeated two times.

134
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,460
So we saw before then when we
have repeated roots, that

135
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,310
means that we would have, let's
say, in a second order

136
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,090
differential equation.

137
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,820
We would have in this case a
discriminant that would be

138
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,610
equal to 0.

139
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,950
And we would need to introduce
in a different type of

140
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,030
solution, because instead of
introducing an exponential of

141
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,160
plus rt exponential minus
rt, now we don't

142
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,240
have the minus rt.

143
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,059
So we need to seek another
type of solution.

144
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,429
And we'll multiply the
exponential by t.

145
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,340
So one type of solution for this
unique root that would

146
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,370
come out would be just 2t.

147
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,240
For the first of the tripled
root, it would be a 3t.

148
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,920
For the second one, we would
have t through t.

149
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,860
For the third one, we need
to go higher order, 3t.

150
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,050
Now we have complex roots, so
that gives us solutions of the

151
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,590
same form that we found
in questions a and b.

152
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:08,290
So I'm going to just write them
here, where now we have

153
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:21,850
the e4t cosine 5t plus
e4t sine 5t.

154
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,070
And for the repeated root,
it's the same game.

155
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,660
Even though we're in complex
roots to the same idea, we

156
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,272
need to multiply
all of it by t.

157
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:41,430

158
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:48,140
So these are the families of
linearly independent solutions

159
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,930
that would come out
of these roots.

160
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,680
So now the general solution is
simply the linear combination

161
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,940
of all these linearly
independent functions.

162
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,860
So we will introduce different
constants.

163
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,570

164
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:12,470
c5, c6, c7, and c8.

165
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,430
And we have eight undetermined
coefficients to deal with,

166
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,810
because these would be eight
roots of an eighth order

167
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,530
polynomial.

168
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,960
And so if we were to solve an
initial value problems like

169
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,550
that, we would need eight
different types of initial

170
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,950
conditions to determine the
values of these constants.

171
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,230
So to summarize, we used the
characteristic polynomial

172
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:39,080
method to solve these problems
introducing higher order

173
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,460
equations than the first
order differential

174
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,880
equations we saw before.

175
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,990
And what is important to
remember is that the different

176
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,930
types of solutions that you get,
depending on the roots of

177
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,260
the characteristic polynomial
and the sine of the

178
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,930
discriminant.

179
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,970
So whether the roots are real or
pure imaginary or imaginary

180
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,130
numbers will give three types
of the behavior, the

181
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,930
critically damped behavior.

182
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,080
If it's real then
it's going to be

183
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,050
just overdamped behavior.

184
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,400
And if the roots are complex,
then it would

185
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,970
be underdamped behavior.

186
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,020
Now when we are given different
types of roots, with

187
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,460
repeat roots it's important to
know how to construct the

188
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,650
solutions as well.

189
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,370
And that's by introducing new
types of functions where we're

190
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:25,400
multiplying by polynomial in t
in front of the exponential.

191
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,100
So that ends the session
for today.

192
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,362
