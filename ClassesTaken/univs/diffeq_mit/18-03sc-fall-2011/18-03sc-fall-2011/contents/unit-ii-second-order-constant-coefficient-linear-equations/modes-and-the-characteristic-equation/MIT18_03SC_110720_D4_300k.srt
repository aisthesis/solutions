00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,422

2
00:00:06,422 --> 00:00:07,570
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,050
Welcome back.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,390
So today, we're going to take
a look at homogeneous

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,020
equations with constant
coefficients, and

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,120
specifically, the case where
we have real roots.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,600
And we'll start the problem off
by looking at the equation

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,770
x dot dot plus 8x dot
plus 7x equals 0.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,770
And we're asked to find the
general solution to this

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,930
differential equation.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,240
And then we also have the
question, do all the solutions

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,730
go to 0 as t goes to infinity?

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,730
And then for part B, we're going
to take a look at just

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,980
the differential equation y
dot equals negative ky.

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,520
So this is the same equation
that we've seen in past

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,220
recitations.

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,210
And we're just going to show
that we can use this method to

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,120
solve this differential
equation and

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,640
obtain the same result.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,490
And then lastly, we're asked,
or we're told that we have

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,690
eight routes to an eighth order
differential equation,

22
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,200
negative 4, negative 3, negative
2, negative 1,

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,980
0, 1, 2, and 3.

24
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,600
And we're asked, what is
the general solution.

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,480
So why don't you take a moment
and try and work these

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,280
problems out, and I'll
be back in a minute.

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:23,840

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,950
Hi, everyone.

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,720
Welcome back.

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,590
OK, so we're asked to find the
general solution to x double

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:40,850
dot plus 8x dot plus
7x equals 0.

32
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,480
And we see that this is a
differential equation, it's

33
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,680
linear, and it has constant
coefficients.

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,600
And whenever we have a
differential equation that's

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,570
linear with constant
coefficients, one of the

36
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,040
standard ways to generate the
solution is to seek what

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,010
sometimes mathematicians call
an ansatz, but it's to try a

38
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,570
solution of the form x is equal
to a constant times e to

39
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,410
the st.

40
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,230
And if we substitute a solution
n of this form, we

41
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,400
see that taking the second
derivative of this function

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,650
pulls down two s's.

43
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,890

44
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,677
One derivative pulls
down one s.

45
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,260

46
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,430
We have no derivatives here.

47
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,922
And we also have, on each term,
a factor of c times e to

48
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:41,800
the st. And we want
this to be 0.

49
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,200
So specifically, ce to the st
can't be 0 for all time.

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,920
So the only way that this can
hold is if s squared plus 8s

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,410
plus 7 equals 0.

52
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,650
So what this means is if we
choose s to solve this

53
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,440
polynomial, then x
equals ce to the

54
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,800
st will be the solution.

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,910
And this will be the solution
for any constant, c.

56
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,910
OK, so what are the roots to
this algebraic equation.

57
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:20,910

58
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,520
Well, we can factorize it.

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,610
The roots are going to be
negative 7 and negative 1.

60
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:32,010

61
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,770
And notice how this whole
process has turned a

62
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,270
differential equation into a
simpler algebraic equation.

63
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,520
So if we can solve the algebraic
equation, then we

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,950
can solve the differential
equation.

65
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,610

66
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,915
OK, so the general solution.

67
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:52,150

68
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,440
Well, we've just shown that we
can take any constant times e

69
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,560
to the st, provided s is equal
to negative 1 or negative 7.

70
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,750
So the general solution is going
to be some constant, c1,

71
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,990
times e to the minus t, plus
c2 can be a different

72
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,180
constant, e to the minus 7t.

73
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,940

74
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,890
So notice how there's
two constants

75
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,269
in the final solution.

76
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,240
And the reason there's two
constants is because we

77
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,360
started out with a second-order

78
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,700
differential equation.

79
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,360
So, in some sense, for each
order of the differential

80
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,330
equation, we always
have one constant.

81
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,020
It's almost as if for each time
we integrate, we have a

82
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,790
constant of integration.

83
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,730
So at the end of the day, we
have two constants in our

84
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,980
general solution.

85
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,230

86
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,280
As part of part A, we're also
asked for any solution to this

87
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,270
differential equation, does the
solution go to 0 as t goes

88
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,830
to infinity?

89
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,110
Well, the general solution
has this form.

90
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,310
So for any constant c1 and c2,
the solution is c1 e to the

91
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,810
minus t plus c2, e
to the minus 7t.

92
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,990
And we see that no matter what
c1 and c2 are, this term, as t

93
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,840
goes to infinity, is multiplied
by e to the minus

94
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,870
t, which goes to 0.

95
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,980
And the second term
also goes to 0.

96
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:17,680
So as t goes to infinity, both
e to the minus t and e to the

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,310
minus 7t both go to 0.

98
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,900
So that means that any constant
times e to the minus

99
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,730
t plus any constant times
e to the minus 7t

100
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,030
must also go to 0.

101
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:40,890
So hence, x of t goes to 0
as t goes to infinity.

102
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,658

103
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:45,130
OK.

104
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:51,850
For part B, we have the
differential equation y dot

105
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,720
equals negative ky.

106
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,730
And this is the first-order
linear differential equation

107
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,790
with constant coefficients.

108
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,590
And we're going to use
the same trick.

109
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,260

110
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:12,250
We let y is equal to c times e
to the st. And we see that the

111
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,840
characteristic equation in
this case, it's not a

112
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,440
polynomial.

113
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,700
It's just s, s is equal
to negative k.

114
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,320

115
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,950
So we get y is equal to
c e to the negative kt

116
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,660
is the general solution.

117
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,690
And this is exactly what we had
in previous recitations,

118
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,940
when we used, for example,
integrating factors to solve

119
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,410
this very same differential
equation.

120
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,590
So this just shows that we can
use the same method to solve

121
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,140
first-order linear differential
equations.

122
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,599

123
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:51,990
OK.

124
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,680
Now, lastly, we're given eight
roots to an eighth-order

125
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,120
differential equation.

126
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,950
An eight-order differential
equations with constant

127
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,590
coefficients.

128
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,050
So I'll just write out
the roots again.

129
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:10,940
So we're told the roots are
negative 4, negative 3,

130
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:20,180
negative 2, negative
1, 0, 1, 2, and 3.

131
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,030
And in general, the solution
to an eighth-order

132
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,410
differential equation whose
roots to the characteristic

133
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:32,500
polynomial are negative 4
through 3, the general

134
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:39,470
solution, x of t, is going to
be a constant c1 times e to

135
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,280
the power of the first root,
which will be minus 4t, plus

136
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,170
c2 e to the minus 3t.

137
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,630
And of course, we
take different

138
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,270
constants for each term.

139
00:07:51,270 --> 00:08:02,050
c3 e to the minus 2t, plus c4
e to the minus t, plus c5.

140
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,315
And now for this term, it should
be e to the 0t, but e

141
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:08,430
to the 0t is just 1.

142
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,920
So the zero root is just going
to give us a constant c5.

143
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:19,990
And we have c6 to the t, plus
c7 to the e to the 2t.

144
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:26,920
And then plus c8 e to the 3t.

145
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,200
So the solution has eight terms
and eight constants.

146
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,850
And just for fun, we can ask,
does every solution to this

147
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,130
differential equation go to
0 as t goes to infinity.

148
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,049
And the answer is no.

149
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:47,840
In fact, although each term with
a negative root does go

150
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,760
to zero as t goes to infinity,
there are three terms that go

151
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,920
to positive infinity as t goes
to infinity, and there's one

152
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,620
term that just stays constant.

153
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,870
So in general, as t grows, goes
to infinity, these terms

154
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,690
will become very large and won't
necessarily go to 0.

155
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,970
Well, they'll never go to 0.

156
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,450
So I'd just like to conclude
there, and I'll

157
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,700
see you next time.

158
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,420
