00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,489

2
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:06,960
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,450
So in this session, we're going
to look at unit step and

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,910
impulse responses.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,800
So in this question, we ask you
to find the unit impulse

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,660
response to these two equations,
x dot plus 2x

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,345
equals f of t, and 2x dot, dot
plus 27 x dot-- oops, it

8
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:22,595
should be a 7--

9
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,660

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,840
plus 7x dot plus 3x
equals f of t.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,200
In the second part, you're asked
to find the unit step

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,450
response for the
first equation.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,140
So here, the key points are
really to remember what do we

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,890
mean by unit impulse and
unit step response.

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,740
Which initial condition
correspond to these responses?

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,040
And what functions of f of t
do you choose in each case?

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,780
So why don't you pause
the video and work

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,530
through this problem?

19
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,780
And I'll be right back.

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:56,230

21
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,460
Welcome back.

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:04,569
So let's look at the equation
A. So the unit impulse

23
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,725
response is simply--

24
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:11,810
I'm going to write this down,
unit impulse response--

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:20,170
is simply the solution to the
following problem to our

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,960
differential equation, x dot
plus 2x that we're given, with

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,930
the forcing in a delta function
of magnitude 1 with

28
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,230
rest initial conditions, which
means in this case, that x of

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,330
0 is equal to 0.

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,990
So 0 minus is equal to 0.

31
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,690
So how do we go about solving
this equation?

32
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,790
So here, first of all, let's
look at what this means.

33
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,810
This equation could be modeling,
for example, the

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,670
quantity of radioactive
chemical in a tank.

35
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,900
And delta t here means that we
are giving a high disturbance

36
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,650
on a very short time
on this system.

37
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,390
So for example, dumping a huge
amount of chemical in that

38
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,660
tank, and then, just letting
the system evolve after

39
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,850
dumping all that chemical
in a tank.

40
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,490
So really, what we could see
is that the delta can be

41
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,539
identified to x dot, which
is the highest

42
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,830
derivative in the system.

43
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,570
And that would then mean that
we have a jump in the second

44
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,630
highest derivative, which
would be an x.

45
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:28,220
So delta t introduces
a jump in x.

46
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,820
And what do I mean by that is
that we had rest initial

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,710
conditions initially.

48
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:41,140
Now, we have to go into a jump
where the quantity of the tank

49
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,000
was raised to 1, which is
basically the magnitude on the

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,470
right-hand side and the fact
that we have no coefficients

51
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,030
for the highest derivative
in the system.

52
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,470
So basically, we can solve this
equation by solving the

53
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:05,070
equivalent problem, x dot
plus 2x equals to 0.

54
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,280
This is just the homogeneous
part with our new initial

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,850
conditions, x of 0 minus
equals to 1.

56
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,600
And so here, clearly from
before, we saw that the

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,300
solution would be a decaying
exponential.

58
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,580
We would have a constant
integration here, which would

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,180
be just 1 given our new
initial condition.

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,990
So this would be valid
for t larger than 0.

61
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,180
And given that we started from
rest initial conditions prior

62
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,020
to this perturbance introduced
by the delta, we could also

63
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,310
write this with a u of t step
function if we were to

64
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,400
consider t in r.

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,710
So if you want to look at how
the solution looks like, we

66
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,870
would have basically rest
initial conditions, and then,

67
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,060
a jump introduced by our
forcing, and after that, just

68
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,120
a decaying exponential, and a
jump here to a new initial

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,910
condition of 1.

70
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,160
So let's move to the
second problem.

71
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,800

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,670
Now, we're dealing with
a second order

73
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,410
differential equation.

74
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:23,880
2x dot, dot plus 7x dot
plus 3x equals f of t.

75
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,610
And we are asked again to seek
the unit impulse response to

76
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,630
this problem.

77
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:39,410
So the unit impulse response is
simply the solution of 2x

78
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:46,880
dot, dot plus 7x dot plus 3x
equals, again, the unit

79
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,330
impulse means that we're just
kicking the system with an

80
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,910
impulse of delta function.

81
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,780
And we're starting from rest
initial conditions.

82
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,690
So here, let's just look at what
could this be modeling.

83
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,310
So this could be just basically
Newton's Second Law

84
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,360
with acceleration and forces
applied to the system.

85
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,880
For example, it could be a mass
hanged on a spring with

86
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,970
certain damping due
to this term.

87
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,080
And this delta here would
have basically the units

88
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,350
corresponding to a force that
would be felt by the highest

89
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,040
order of term in the integral
which could correspond to the

90
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,760
acceleration multiplied, for
example, by a mass of 2.

91
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,450
So really, the delta can be
identified to the highest

92
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,360
order derivative, which means
that we would have a

93
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,590
discontinuity from 0 to 1 on
the derivative one degree

94
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,280
lower, so in x dot.

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:51,140
And so the delta introduces
the discontinuity on the

96
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,460
second highest derivative.

97
00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,090
And what I mean by that is that
we have a jump from our

98
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:07,160
original initial conditions of
x dot 0 minus equals to 0 to

99
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,420
new initial conditions, x dot
of 0 minus equals one half.

100
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,190
Where did this one
half come from?

101
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,610
It came from the fact that I
have a factor of 2 in front of

102
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,720
the highest order derivative.

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,810
So If I'm identifying this with
delta, then integration

104
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,610
of this term would give me an x
dot that corresponds to the

105
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,340
jump from 0 to 1 over
2, so one half.

106
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,400
That's where it comes from.

107
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,470
And each time that you would
have a coefficient in front of

108
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,270
your highest order derivative
associated with the delta on

109
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,040
the right, you would have
a jump of 1 over that

110
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,270
coefficient.

111
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,920
So from this point, what
are we solving?

112
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,900
What do we need to solve to get
the unit impulse response?

113
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:54,500
It's equivalent to solving our
new system where we can then

114
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:04,850
get rid of the delta with our
new initial conditions, dot

115
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,610
equals one half.

116
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,620
And of course, here, I did
mentioned by the initial

117
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,090
condition on x0 minus 1, because
we need two initial

118
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,700
conditions for the second order
derivative, would still

119
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,770
be 0 as the discontinuity
would not be felt by the

120
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,050
function x itself.

121
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,550
So we can go ahead and
solve this problem.

122
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,670
So we use the characteristic
polynomial as we did before.

123
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,440

124
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,710
This characteristic polynomial
would have a discriminate of

125
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,940
25, which gives us simple roots
that we can compute, so

126
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,080
minus 7 plus or minus the
square root of the

127
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,910
discriminant over 4.

128
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:53,250

129
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,750
So we have two roots, minus 7
minus 5 over 4 minus 12 over

130
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,550
4, which is minus 3, minus 7
plus 5 over 4, which just

131
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,630
gives us minus one half.

132
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:11,160
So we can write down the
solution to this problem as C1

133
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,870
exponential the root that we
just found minus 3t plus C2

134
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,990
exponential the other root,
minus one half of t.

135
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,570
Now, to get C1, C2, we need to
take into account the initial

136
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,520
conditions.

137
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,550
So the first one tells
us that x at 0 is 0.

138
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,590
So that will give us C1 plus C2
equals to 0, so basically,

139
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,200
C2 equals minus C1.

140
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,750
And the second initial condition
tells us that the

141
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,780
derivative is 0.

142
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:48,320
So that gives us minus 3C1 minus
one half C2 equals to 0.

143
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,790
Here, we have that C2 is
equal to minus C1.

144
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,595
So we can just factor
out everything.

145
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:57,850
And we end up with 3 minus
one half-- whoops, sorry.

146
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,860
Here it should be one half,
our new modified initial

147
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:07,120
condition, equals to one half.

148
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,080
And here, you would have
5/2 equal to 1/2.

149
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,780
So C2 equals 1/5 equals
minus C1.

150
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,410
And so plugging in C1 and C2 in
this formula would give us

151
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:31,510
the general solution with C2
exponential minus one half t

152
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,090
minus exponential minus 3t.

153
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,550
And all of this, remember, we're
solving for t larger

154
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,410
than 0 in our modified system
with our new initial

155
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,320
conditions.

156
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,190
So this is for t
larger than 0.

157
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,230
And again, here, if we wanted
to just write it for t or r,

158
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,960
then we could just add the step
function u of t dot to

159
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,740
signify that we took rest
initial conditions before x

160
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,640
equals 0 minus.

161
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,460
So that ends the first part.

162
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,370
So now quickly, for the second
part, we're asked to find the

163
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:09,270
unit step response to
the first system.

164
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:17,460
So the unit step response is
just the solution to our

165
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,900
original ODE problem,
x dot plus 2x.

166
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,580
But now, f of t is the step
function, hence, the step

167
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,900
here, with still rest
initial conditions.

168
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,180
So really, the step
function is just 0

169
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,140
everywhere before 0 minus.

170
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,320
And it takes the value
of 1 after.

171
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:47,320
And so basically, we can just
solve again for t positive,

172
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,640
the modified differential
equation with u taking just

173
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,940
the value of 1.

174
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,680
And here, we just get
similar roots.

175
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,290
So it would be a minus 2t.

176
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,510
But then, we would
have a constant

177
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,650
integration to worry about.

178
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,220
And a new particular solution,
a lucky guess

179
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,290
would just be a constant.

180
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,990
And that would give us the
one half from 1 or 2.

181
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,110
So then, we just need to seek
the C1 that would give us x of

182
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,620
t equals to 0 at 0.

183
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,210
Because in this case, we don't
need to modify the initial

184
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:21,710
conditions.

185
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,540
They still remain the same,
rest initial conditions.

186
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:34,940
And so we would get here just
C1 equals minus one half.

187
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,190
So we have 1 minus exponential
of minus 2t.

188
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,490
So just here, something I forgot
to mention, what could

189
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,670
this be modeling?

190
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,710
So this could be modeling, if I
go back to my analogy of the

191
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,320
radioactive chemical in the
tank, this would be telling me

192
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,940
that after a certain time, I
start inputting at a steady

193
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,160
rate at a constant rate of u of
t of one per unit of time

194
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,110
the amount in the tank and then
looking at how the system

195
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,720
evolves to that.

196
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,900
So there's no abrupt change
that introduces a

197
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,680
discontinuity.

198
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,360
So just to conclude, I just want
to sketch the solution

199
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,210
just so that you see the
difference between the two.

200
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,980
And here, what we have, again,
I could have introduced my u

201
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,920
of t here if I want t in R. So
here, we have again a solution

202
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,010
that is 0 before.

203
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,320
There is no discontinuity.

204
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,870
It's still 0 at 0 minus.

205
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,590
And then, we have basically a
solution that is growing until

206
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,970
it reaches an asymptote
of one half when this

207
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,610
exponential goes to 0.

208
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,930
And so you can see that it's a
smooth transition because I

209
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,410
just started inputting the
amount of the chemical in the

210
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,470
tank in a non-abrupt way.

211
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,180
So this concludes
this session.

212
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,020
And the key here was to really
remember what do we mean by

213
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,700
the unit step response.

214
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,550
What type of f of t are
we talking about?

215
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,410
What initial conditions
do we need?

216
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,660
And same thing for the unit
impulse response.

217
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,588
