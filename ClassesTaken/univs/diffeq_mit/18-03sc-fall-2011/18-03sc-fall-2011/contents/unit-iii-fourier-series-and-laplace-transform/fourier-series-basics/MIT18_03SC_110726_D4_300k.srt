00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,392

00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:06,070
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,560
Welcome back.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,100
So today we'd like to tackle a
problem in Fourier series.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,610
And specifically, we're just
going to compute the Fourier

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,510
series for a simple function.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,210
So the function we're interested
in is f of t, which

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,490
we're told is periodic
with period 2pi.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,650
F of t is 1 from minus pi
to 0, and then it's

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,880
minus 1 from 0 to pi.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,160
So first off, we're interested
in sketching f of t.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,890
Secondly, we'd like to compute
the Fourier series for f of t.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,070
And then thirdly, we'd like to
sketch the first non-0 term of

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,640
the Fourier series.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,590
And we can specifically sketch
this single term

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,300
on top of f of t.

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,530
So I'll let you think about this
problem for now, and I'll

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,780
be back in a moment.

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:08,690

20
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,900
Hi, everyone.

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,060
Welcome back.

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,340
So let's take a look at
sketching f of t.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:23,140

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,560
So for part a, we have
our axes, t.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,500
And we're told f of t within
some interval.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,280
So we might as well plot f
of t on that interval.

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:47,180
So minus pi, pi and 0, we
know that f of t is 1

28
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,820
from minus pi to 0.

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,080
We're also told that it's
minus 1 from 0 to pi.

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,110

31
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,930
And now to fill in the blanks or
to complete the picture of

32
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,260
f, we're told that it
has a period of 2pi.

33
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,300
So note that they've told us
what f looks like over the

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,560
range of minus pi to pi, which
is the length of 2pi.

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,260
So basically what we can do is
we can use this as a stamp and

36
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,630
just pick up this entire
picture, shift it over one

37
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,170
period 2pi, and just thinking of
this picture in stamping it

38
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,690
in multiple places.

39
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:37,940
So just filling this in it's
going to look like a square

40
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:47,690
wave, which jumps between
minus 1 and 1 at every

41
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,640
multiple of pi.

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,890
So this concludes part a.

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,980
For part b, which is the real
meat of the problem, we're

44
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,010
interested in computing a
Fourier series for f of t.

45
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,290
Now, we can always write down
a Fourier series for any

46
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,530
periodic function.

47
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,430
And specifically in this case,
for part b, the periodic

48
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,810
function we're interested
in has period 2pi.

49
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,630
So for the class notes,
we've identified L

50
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,230
with half the period.

51
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,300
So in this case, L is
2pi divided by 2,

52
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,190
which gives us pi.

53
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,200
And just to recall what a
Fourier series is, what we do

54
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,630
is we try and take our function
f of t and write it

55
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,730
down as a summation of
sines and cosines.

56
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,730
So in this case for function f
of t, which is 2pi periodic,

57
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,190
it's going to look something
like this.

58
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:54,155
It's going to a of 0 plus
sum from n equals 1.

59
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:57,880
And there's going to be
infinitely many terms, but in

60
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,130
this case we have a of
n times cosine of nt.

61
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,280
And it's nt here because
we have period 2pi.

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,635
Plus bn sin nt.

63
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:13,440

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,589
So this is the general form.

65
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,269
And when asked to compute the
Fourier series of a function,

66
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,370
the main difficulty is
to compute these

67
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,320
coefficients an and bn.

68
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,790
However, that essentially
boils down to

69
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,040
working out some integrals.

70
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,790

71
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,120
So let's take a look
at what a of 0 is.

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,140

73
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,770
So the formula for
a0 is 1 over 2L.

74
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,920
So in this case, it's 1 over
2pi, times the integral over 1

75
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,910
period of the function,
from minus pi to pi,

76
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,160
of just f of t.

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,600

78
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,100
So notice how a0 is just the
average of the function.

79
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,810
So if we take a look at the
function f of t, f of t spends

80
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,160
exactly half of its time
at 1 and half of its

81
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,570
time at minus 1.

82
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,942
So immediately we could guess
that the average value of f of

83
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:13,192
t is going to be 0.

84
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:16,730

85
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,010
If you wanted to work it out
specifically, we would have 1

86
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:29,180
over 2pi minus pi to 0, f of t
takes on the value of plus 1.

87
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,340

88
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,900
And then from 0 to pi, f of t
takes on the value of minus 1.

89
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,460

90
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,380
So we would end up getting
pi minus pi, which is 0.

91
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,160

92
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:56,810
For an, the formula is 1
over half the period.

93
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,320
So note how a of 0 is
just a special case.

94
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,480
We always have the full period
in a0, but in an and bn, the

95
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,550
factor that divides the integral
is always going to be

96
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:23,090
half the period times minus pi
to pi f of t cosine nt dt.

97
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,070
And I should point out that,
in general, we only need to

98
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,520
integrate over one period
of the function.

99
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,130
So in some sense there's
nothing special about

100
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,860
minus pi and pi.

101
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,740
It's just very often these
are the easiest bounds of

102
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,790
integration to integrate over.

103
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,230

104
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,850
But in practice, we could have
used 0 to 2pi or any other

105
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,660
interval, as long as
it's exactly one

106
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,910
period of the function.

107
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,100

108
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,260
So in this case, I'd just like
to take a look at the

109
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,320
symmetry of f of t.

110
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,270
And we note that the function
f of t is actually odd about

111
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,410
the origin.

112
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,965
So if f of t is odd and cosine t
is an even function, then an

113
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:12,420
odd times an even function is
going to be an odd function.

114
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,650
And when you integrate an odd
function from minus any value

115
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,520
to the same positive value, so
in this case minus pi to pi,

116
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,810
we always get 0.

117
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,740
So this is actually 0, because
we're integrating an odd

118
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,030
function over a symmetric
interval.

119
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:40,760

120
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:48,730
So lastly, we have the values
of bn, which are 1 over pi

121
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:59,200
minus pi to pi f of
t of sine nt dt.

122
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,193
And if we were to look at just
the symmetry argument again, f

123
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:06,280
of t is an odd function, sine
t is an odd function, an odd

124
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,560
times an odd function
is an even function.

125
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,120
When you integrate an even
function over a symmetric

126
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,920
bound, you will essentially
get twice the value of the

127
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,200
integral from 0 to one
of the bounds.

128
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,880
So b of n in this case doesn't
vanish, which means we

129
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,130
actually have to do some work.

130
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,160

131
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,020
So what we do?

132
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,090
Well, we know the value of f
of t on two intervals, so

133
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,909
we're just going to have to
work out each interval.

134
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,330
Minus pi is 0, it takes
on the value of 1.

135
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,580
So we have sine nt.

136
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,290

137
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:51,790
And then from 0 to pi, f of t
takes on the value of minus 1

138
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,650
sine nt dt.

139
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,220
And you'll note that
these integrals are

140
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,470
actually the same.

141
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,300

142
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:15,940
So this is negative 2 over pi
zero to pi sine nt dt, which

143
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:27,080
if we integrate is negative 1
over n cosine nt evaluated

144
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,330
between 0 and pi.

145
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,620

146
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:41,620
So if I work this out, we get
minus and a minus, minus 1

147
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:51,360
over n cosine n pi
plus 1 over n.

148
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,170
So note that cosine
of 0 is just 1.

149
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,950

150
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,630
And now if we take a look at
cosine n pi, we see that

151
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,600
cosine n pi oscillates between
minus 1 and 1.

152
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,500
So cosine of pi is negative 1,
cosine of 2pi is 1, cosine of

153
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,180
3pi is minus 1.

154
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,160
So this term right here is
actually negative 1 to the n.

155
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,240

156
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:26,861
So we have 2 over n pi 1 minus
negative 1 to the n.

157
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:32,990

158
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,320
And now if we just plug in some
values of b of 1, b of 2,

159
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,520
b of 3, b of 4, we can see what
pattern merges in the bs.

160
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,930
So b of 1, if I plug in 1,
I get 1 minus negative 1.

161
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,570
It's going to be 2.

162
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,490
So I get minus 4 over pi.

163
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:03,270
b of 2 it's going to
be 1 minus minus 1

164
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,320
squared is just 1.

165
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,570
So this vanishes.

166
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,360

167
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,890
b of 3 is going to be 1 minus
minus 1 cubed, which is

168
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,360
negative 1.

169
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,460
So again, we get negative
4 over 3pi.

170
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,330

171
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,650
b of 4 is going to be 0.

172
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:29,280

173
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,950
So it's sometimes useful the
write out what the Fourier

174
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,890
series looks like.

175
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,540
So I'll just write it
out right here.

176
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,040

177
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:47,710
So we have f of t is going to
be negative 4 over pi times

178
00:11:47,710 --> 00:12:01,470
sine of t plus 1/3 sine of
3t plus 1/5 sine of 5t

179
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,320
plus dot, dot, dot.

180
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,960

181
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:15,050
So this concludes part b.

182
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,990
And now lastly, for part c,
we're asked to sketch what

183
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,270
does the first Fourier
term look like.

184
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,050
So in this case, the first
Fourier term is going to be

185
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,350
negative 4 over pi
times sine t.

186
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,520
So I'm going to go back to
our diagram from part a.

187
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,180
So let's go back to our
diagram from part a.

188
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,530
Now what is minus 4 over
pi sine t look like?

189
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:46,190
Well, it's a sine wave that has
exactly period 2pi, and

190
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,250
it's going to line up exactly
with this square wave. In

191
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,740
addition, minus 4 over pi is
just slightly larger than 1.

192
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,370
So we're going to end up with
sin, which peaks just slightly

193
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,560
above 1 and slightly below 1.

194
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,100
It's going to go through 0, and
it's going to go through

195
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,010
each multiple of pi.

196
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,400
So it might look something
like this.

197
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:28,590

198
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:36,285
So this is the first Fourier
term in the series.

199
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,980

200
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,000
And notice how this first
Fourier term is actually

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,170
pretty good approximation to the
square wave, considering

202
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,860
it's just one term
in a series.

203
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,120
As we add more terms in the
series, we're going to get

204
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,540
something which looks
closer and closer to

205
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,790
a square wave function.

206
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,500

207
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,740
So I'd just like to
quickly recap.

208
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,130
When computing the Fourier
series for a periodic

209
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,410
function, the first useful thing
to do is just write down

210
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,530
the formula for a Fourier
series, and then write down

211
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,130
the formulas for the
coefficients

212
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,930
of the Fourier series.

213
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,260
So write down the formulas
for a0 an, bn.

214
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,810
When computing a0, you can often
just look at the average

215
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,740
of the function.

216
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,590
When computing an and bn, it's
also useful look at the

217
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,910
symmetry of your function.

218
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,420
And if it's either even or odd
symmetric then typically,

219
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,380
either all the ans or all
the bns will vanish.

220
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,950
And then when you work at the
integrals, you can then

221
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,700
reconstruct the Fourier
series.

222
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,410
So I would like to conclude
here, and I'll

223
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,660
see you next time.

224
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,855
