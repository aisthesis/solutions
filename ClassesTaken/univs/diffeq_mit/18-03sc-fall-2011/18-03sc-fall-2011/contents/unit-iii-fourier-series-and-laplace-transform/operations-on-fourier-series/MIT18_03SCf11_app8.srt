1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,190
The Fourier coefficients applet
lets us explore the

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,450
approximation of periodic
functions by Fourier series.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,660
This is the opening screen
of the applet.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,780
On the right, you see a series
of sliders controlling

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,840
coefficients.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,590
And they're the coefficients of
the sine terms in a Fourier

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,780
series, as you can see by
clicking this formula box.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,906
So at this point, what we're
studying is an odd function, a

10
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:32,720
sine series, and the sliders
let us control the

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,480
coefficients of sine of kt.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,340

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,720
If I click the cosine box,
I'd see coefficients

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,430
of the cosine functions.

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:53,350
Let's go back to sine and start
to play with the tool a

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,590
little bit.

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,670
What will happen if I
move the b2 slider?

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,700
I should get multiples of the
sine of 2t showing up on my

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,040
graphing window.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,120
If I push b2 to the right, I get
positive multiples of the

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,695
sine of 2t.

22
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:14,120
The sine of 2t goes through two
full periods when t ranges

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,370
from 0 to 2pi.

24
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,750

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,340
And if b2 is negative, I
get negative multiples

26
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,590
of the sine of 2t.

27
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,560

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,730
What happens if I change
b1 in this tool?

29
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,960
This will add a multiple of the
sine of t to the function

30
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,790
that I already have.

31
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,730
If I push this to the right,
I'm going to get positive

32
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,170
multiples of the sine of 2t, and
you can see the alteration

33
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,870
in the yellow graph
when I do that.

34
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,930
When I push b1 to the left, I'm
adding negative multiples

35
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,290
of the sine of t.

36
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,070
You get quite a variety of
interesting functions by

37
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,940
playing with these
various sliders.

38
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,700
But it's even more fun to try
to match a target periodic

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,660
function by means of sine
or cosine series.

40
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,210
And the tool has built into it
a whole family of target

41
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,550
functions to try for.

42
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,860
Right now, the target
function is 0.

43
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,450
But we can select target A
instead, and what we have now

44
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,720
is a square wave.

45
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,190
Actually, this isn't the
standard square wave that we

46
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,700
deal with in the
course, quite.

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,600
It is periodic, of period 2pi,
and alternates between

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,300
positive and negative values,
but those values are pi over 4

49
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,150
and minus pi over 4, instead of
plus 1 and minus 1, as they

50
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,940
are for the standard
square wave.

51
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,340
That's chosen so that the
Fourier coefficients come out

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,340
more neatly, as we'll see.

53
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,920
So let's try to approximate
this function by a finite

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,870
trigonometric sum.

55
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,250
I'm going to push the Reset
key here to reset all the

56
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,260
coefficients to zero, and start
trying to match the

57
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,320
function that I have at hand
with multiples of sine of kt.

58
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,170
Let's begin with the sine
function itself, sine of t.

59
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,040
Well, I don't know what to do.

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,300
Let's just set it so the
maxima coincide.

61
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,870
Why not?

62
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,720
Maybe that will be an
appropriate amount of the sine

63
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,230
of t function to put into the
pot when I'm trying to mix up

64
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,660
the square wave.

65
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,810
Let's go on to b2 now.

66
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,670
I'm going to push the B2
slider to the right.

67
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,680
When I do that, you see a hump
forming on the left-hand side

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,130
of the positive part
of the square wave.

69
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,570
If push b2 to the left, the same
kind of hump forms on the

70
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,880
right-hand side of that
positive part

71
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,180
of the square wave.

72
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,390
Neither one of them seems to
be doing us very much good.

73
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,930
And in fact, it's creating an
asymmetry in the Fourier

74
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,930
series that's not present
in our target function.

75
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,570
It's not respecting the symmetry
that you see around

76
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,910
pi over 2 in the square
wave itself.

77
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,060
So I suspect that b2 is not
going to be useful to us, that

78
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,550
the sine of 2t is not going
to be a constituent in the

79
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,050
Fourier series for
square wave.

80
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,580
In fact, I think that none
of the even sines will be

81
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,920
of any use to us.

82
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,680
And I can get rid of them and
look only at the odd terms by

83
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,200
clicking this Odd Terms box.

84
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,340
This leaves the sine function
that we had in place.

85
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,690
It eliminates all the odd
terms in the series.

86
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:04,570
It eliminates all the even
coefficients and leaves us

87
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,160
only with the odd ones.

88
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,130
But there are more of them, so
we should be able to do a

89
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,240
better job of approximating
the square wave.

90
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,590
So let's continue.

91
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,680
Let's try changing b3 to get
a good approximation.

92
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,110
Well, I can push b3 to the
left, and I get a sharper

93
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,980
spike in the middle.

94
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,130
That doesn't look too good.

95
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,710
It looks better to push
b3 to the right and

96
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,020
flatten out the top.

97
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,780
But when I do that, the
top becomes too low.

98
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,160
And so maybe I made a mistake
in changing b1 so that the

99
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,260
maxima agreed.

100
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,040
Maybe I should have made
b1 a little bit bigger.

101
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,540
Now you can see the white curve
there-- that's giving me

102
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,400
the multiple of the sine wave
itself, the one that I'm

103
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,570
controlling by this slider.

104
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,030
And I guess I should push it up
so that my flat part comes

105
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,500
closer to the top of
the square wave.

106
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,940
Maybe that's a better
approximation.

107
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,510
Well, I can continue playing
this game, trying out various

108
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,150
multiples of higher sine
functions, and going back to

109
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,615
try to fix up what
I had before.

110
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:09,240

111
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,650
In fact, what we should be
trying to do is create a least

112
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,670
squares fit.

113
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,880
You should try to look at the
root mean squared distance

114
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,200
between the Fourier series and
the target function, and

115
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,670
minimize that distance.

116
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,750
That distance can be read out
in this tool by clicking the

117
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,125
Distance button down here.

118
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,470
And so the root mean squared
distance between the green

119
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,770
curve and the yellow one is 0.24
and so on, in this case.

120
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,670
Let me come down here and
kill the formula.

121
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,470
We know the formula well now,
and it makes the screen a

122
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,860
little less cluttered
if we get rid of it.

123
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:57,050
And let me reset the values of
the coefficients to zero, and

124
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,430
start to try to approximate
this square wave again by

125
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,500
watching the root mean squared
distance between the Fourier

126
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,610
series that I'm creating and
the target function.

127
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,140
So I'll start with b1 in this
case, If I move it down, the

128
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,470
distance increases.

129
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,240
If I move it up, the
distance decreases

130
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,650
more and more slowly.

131
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,810
But now when b1 becomes
greater than one,

132
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,880
it starts to increase.

133
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,610
So let me push it down again.

134
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,910
I can use these little arrow
keys to step the value of b1.

135
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,480
That's very convenient.

136
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,280
I'm just watching the root mean
squared distance, this

137
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,190
number up here.

138
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,870
I'm trying to make that
as small as possible.

139
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,770
It's a measure of the
closeness of fit.

140
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,800
Ah, it just started
to increase again.

141
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,150
Let me step up.

142
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,120
And I found the value of one.

143
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,580
I didn't set it to one.

144
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,870
I set it to the value that
minimized this number.

145
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,670
And that's the right quantity of
the sine wave to put in, if

146
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,390
you want to mix up the square
wave, or rather pi over 4

147
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,170
times the square wave.

148
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,110
Let's look at b3.

149
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,970
Again, if I decrease b3,
things get worse.

150
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,390
The root mean squared
distance increases.

151
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:15,780
But if I increase b3 above the
value of zero, that number is

152
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,880
getting smaller.

153
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,920
Now it's growing again.

154
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,640
I think I'll stop there and
use these arrow keys.

155
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,200
That's better, that's better,
that's better, that's worse.

156
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,320
Let me go back.

157
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,100
And I find the value
0.33 for b3.

158
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,419
That's the optimal amount of
the sine of 3t to put in if

159
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,960
you want to mix up the formula
for this square wave.

160
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,080
I'll do one more.

161
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,410
Any guesses for what the optimal
value of b5 should be?

162
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,670
It's not going to be negative.

163
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,290
That will increase the root
mean squared distance.

164
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,640
Let's push it up in the
positive direction.

165
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,200
That's about right.

166
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,526
That's worse, that's better,
that's better,

167
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:03,840
better, better, worse.

168
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,470
I come down here.

169
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,720
That's optimal.

170
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,380

171
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,670
We've discovered by
experimentation with this

172
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,850
applet that the optimal
value of b5 is 0.200.

173
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,740
Each one of these coefficients
seems to have optimal value

174
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,280
equal to the reciprocal
of the index.

175
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,590
1/3 in this case, 1 in this
case, 1/5 in this case.

176
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,550
And I predict that the optimal
value of b7 is going to be

177
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:37,600
1/7, which is about 0.14.

178
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,605
There you go.

179
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:39,855
it's right in there.

180
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:42,030

181
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,580
So this applet lets you
understand the true meaning of

182
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,420
the Fourier coefficients.

183
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,310
They're the multiples of the
sine waves or the cosine waves

184
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,380
which give you the optimal
fit, in terms of a finite

185
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,540
Fourier series, to the
target function.

186
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,119
