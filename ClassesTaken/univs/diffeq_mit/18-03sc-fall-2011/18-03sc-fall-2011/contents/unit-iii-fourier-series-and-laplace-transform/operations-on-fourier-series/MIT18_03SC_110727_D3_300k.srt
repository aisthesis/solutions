00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,870
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,280
Welcome back.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,660
So today I'd like to look at
a problem on a manipulating

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,070
Fourier series.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,840
Specifically, we're asked to
find the Fourier series of

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,950
cosine 2t minus pi/4.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,840
And then the second problem is
given a square wave function,

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,100
which takes on the value
of minus 1 and 1,

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,650
and it's 2pi periodic.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,870
We're also told that the square
wave function has the

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,520
Fourier series 4/pi,
1/n, sine nt.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,280
And the question is to find the
Fourier series of three

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,770
related functions.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,120
So the first function takes on
the value of 0 and 4 on the

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,960
intervals minus pi
to 0 and 0 to pi.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,440
Note that this function
is also 2pi periodic.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,030
The second problem it is to find
the Fourier series of a

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,590
function which is minus
1 from minus 1 to 0,

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,130
and 1 from 0 to 1.

21
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,720
So this is the square
wave function, but

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,700
now has period two.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,140
And then lastly we're asked to
find the Fourier series of a

24
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,810
function f of t, which
is absolute t.

25
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,930
And it's defined as absolute
t on the interval

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,270
from minus pi to pi.

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,440
However this function f is going
to be extended on the

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,160
entire domain with period 2pi.

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,000
So I'll let you think about this
problem and I'll be back

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,250
in a moment.

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:33,880

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,020
Hi everyone.

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,700
Welcome back.

34
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,800
So let's take a look at the
first problem, finding the

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,620
Fourier series of cosine
2t minus pi/4.

36
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:48,770

37
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,370
So in this class when we say
find the Fourier series, what

38
00:01:51,370 --> 00:02:00,990
we're really looking for are
coefficients a0 an and bn,

39
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:07,340
such that, for example, we can
write our function out as a

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,470
sum of sine and cosines with
these values an and bn.

41
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,540
Now, what we could do is we
could take this function, plug

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,930
it into the integral formulas,
and compute using integrals,

43
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,100
the value a0, an, and bn.

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,610
However, there's a
bit of a trick.

45
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,520
And that's to realize that this
function, cosine 2t minus

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,570
pi/4 is really just a sinusoidal
function with a

47
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,440
single frequency.

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,340
And it's currently in an
amplitude phase form.

49
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,130
And we can always convert an
amplitude phase form of a

50
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,490
sinusoidal function into some
amplitude times a sine and

51
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,540
some amplitude times a cosine
and add the two up.

52
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:58,480
So specifically, this can be
done by recalling the cosine

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:09,940
identity, cosine A minus B, is
cosine A times cosine B plus

54
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,820
sine of A, sine of B.

55
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:23,040
And if we identify A with 2t
and B with pi/4, we obtain

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:33,240
that f of t is cosine
2t cosine pi/4 plus

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,270
sine 2t sine of pi/4.

58
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,960

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,950
And now sine pi/4 and cosine
pi/4 are both 1 over root 2.

60
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:54,570

61
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:02,180
So f of t becomes 1 over
root 2 cosine 2t plus 1

62
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,450
over root 2 sine 2t.

63
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,750

64
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,960
And that's it.

65
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,460
So when we take a look at this
expression for f of t, we see

66
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,430
that this is actually in exactly
the same form that we

67
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,130
were seeking in the beginning,
the Fourier series

68
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,730
representation for f.

69
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,640
So this is the end
of the problem.

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,315
We don't have to actually
compute any integrals.

71
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:29,270

72
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,160
So now let's take a
look at part two.

73
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,320
So for part two, we're asked to
find the Fourier series of

74
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
several different functions.

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,990
And I'll just take a
look at part one.

76
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:54,160

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,190
So in this case, f of t takes
on the value of 0 from minus

78
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,560
pi to zero, and the value
of 4 from 0 to pi.

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:15,330
And if I were to quickly sketch
this function, it would

80
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:23,630
look like a square wave,
0, pi, minus pi.

81
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,880
This is f of t.

82
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,050

83
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,670
And we see that it's
actually related--

84
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,030
I can draw in dashes
just to be clear--

85
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,970
what the original square wave
function might look like.

86
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,530
So this is square wave of t.

87
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,360

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,020
We see that if we were to take
the square wave function and

89
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,330
shift it up, the square wave
takes on values of

90
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,780
plus 1 and minus 1.

91
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,150
But if we take the square wave
function and shift it up 1

92
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,530
unit, and then rescale it, we'll
then get the function

93
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,360
we're looking for, f of t.

94
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,120
So specifically, we can write f
of t in terms of the square

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,860
wave as well.

96
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,340
We have to shift the square wave
function up 1, and then

97
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,820
we have to amplify it
by a factor of 2.

98
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,430
So then when we seek the Fourier
series for f, all we

99
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,390
have to do is substitute the
Fourier series for the square

100
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,640
wave function n.

101
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,760

102
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,870
So let's do this.

103
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,650
So we have 1 plus 4/pi.

104
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,580

105
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,650
So I'm writing here this Fourier
series for the square

106
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:42,840
wave function, n odd
1/n sine nt.

107
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,600

108
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,250
So by manipulating the Fourier
series for the square wave

109
00:06:52,250 --> 00:07:02,230
function, we can arrive at a
Fourier series for f of t, n

110
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,380
odd 1/n sine nt.

111
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,940

112
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,190
So this is the first function.

113
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,930

114
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,710
The second function f of t--

115
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,840
I'll just rewrite it again--

116
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:30,830
f of t takes on the value of
negative 1 from negative 1 to

117
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,890
0, and takes on the value
of plus 1 from 0 to 1.

118
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,400

119
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,820
So it's somewhat useful to draw,
just to quickly sketch

120
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,070
this function.

121
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,540

122
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,875
And I'll draw in my axes here.

123
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,310

124
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,560
So this is f of t.

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,590

126
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,780
This is t.

127
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,900
And it transitions.

128
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,090

129
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,725
It makes its jumps
at the integers.

130
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,420

131
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,960
So for example, it jumps from
plus 1 to minus 1 at 1, and

132
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,570
from plus 1 to minus 1
at minus 1 as well.

133
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,380
And if I were to just quickly
sketch the square wave

134
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:34,309
function underneath of it, the
square wave function makes its

135
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:40,880
transitions at minus
pi and pi.

136
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,640
So this is the square
wave function.

137
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,890
This is t.

138
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,310

139
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:55,560
So we see that we can take the
square wave function and

140
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,410
squeeze it to obtain this
function f of t.

141
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,160
And the question now is, what
factor do we have to squeeze

142
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,170
the square wave function
by to get f of t.

143
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,240
Well, usually what I like to do
is take one characteristic

144
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,780
point in the sketch
for in this case

145
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,630
the square wave function.

146
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,210
So a nice characteristic point
is when the square wave

147
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,430
function has a 0, so when it
goes through the origin, and

148
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,840
compare it to the same point
on this function f of t.

149
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,920
So we see that the point
pi has to get stretched

150
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,810
to the point 1.

151
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,340
So we basically need to take
the time axis in the square

152
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,020
wave function and squeeze
it by a factor of pi.

153
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,080

154
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,310
So what this means is that f of
t is going to be the square

155
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,700
wave. And when we do what
mathematicians sometimes

156
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,650
called a dilatation, a
stretch or a squeeze.

157
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,770
If we're squeezing by some
factor, that factor always

158
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:03,610
appears in the argument of the
function we're squeezing.

159
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,830
If it's a stretch, then
it would be t

160
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,440
over the stretch factor.

161
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,810
And we can quickly check here
that if t equals 1, so as t

162
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,500
goes from 0 to 1, so when t is
1, the square wave function is

163
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,750
being evaluated at pi.

164
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,610

165
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,390
And I'll now write out
the Fourier series.

166
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:37,460
So this is going to be
4/pi sum of n odd 1/n

167
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,290
sine of n pi t.

168
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,300

169
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,640
And there's another quick
check we can do.

170
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,330
And that's this function
f we were told is

171
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,500
periodic with period 2.

172
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,810
And if we just take a look at
this function here, the

173
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,480
Fourier series representation of
it, we see that each sine n

174
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,630
pi t is in fact periodic
with period 2.

175
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,980
So that's just another quick,
back of the envelope check

176
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,650
that we've done our calculation
correctly.

177
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,910
So this concludes part two.

178
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,700
And then lastly than for part
three, f of t is the absolute

179
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,340
value of t from minus
pi to pi.

180
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,520
And it's extended beyond
minus pi to pi

181
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,430
to make it 2pi periodic.

182
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,570
And at first it might look like
this function f of t is

183
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,620
not related to the square
wave function.

184
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,450
But if we look at it a little
more carefully, and analyze

185
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,360
the derivative of f of t, we see
that this function takes

186
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,240
on the value plus 1 on the
interval of 0 to pi and takes

187
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,940
on the value of minus 1 on the
interval of minus pi to 0.

188
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:58,700
And this is exactly the square
wave. So what we can do is we

189
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,260
can write f of t.

190
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,045
It's going to be an integral of
the square wave function.

191
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:10,730

192
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:17,820
So specifically, we have the
integral of square wave, which

193
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:24,545
is going to be the integral
of 4/pi 1/n sine

194
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:35,890
nt summation n odd.

195
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,920

196
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,310
And I'm going to leave this
as an indefinite integral.

197
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:48,420
So when we integrate, we have
a constant of integration c

198
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:57,190
plus 4/pi sum of 1
over n squared.

199
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,340
And we have negative
cosine nt.

200
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,270

201
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,520
And this is n odd again.

202
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,190

203
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,650
And now we have one last
question to answer.

204
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,010
What is the constant
of integration?

205
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,290
Well, notice how the constant
of integration can be

206
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,660
identified with the a0 term
of a Fourier series.

207
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,420
So if we want the constant of
integration, we can just

208
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:31,170
calculate it directly by the
integral formula for the a0 of

209
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,390
this function.

210
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,300
So what this means is c
is going to be 1/2pi.

211
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,950

212
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,730
Essentially it's just the
average of the function, but

213
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:51,860
it's pi to pi, the absolute
value of t, which is 1/pi, pi

214
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,890
squared over 2.

215
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,140
So we get pi/2.

216
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,160

217
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,240
So just to quickly recap, in
this problem we were given

218
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,180
several functions which
were related to

219
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,880
the square wave function.

220
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,740
And we started off knowing what
the Fourier series for

221
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,680
the square wave function was.

222
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,030
And by manipulating or rewriting
these functions in

223
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,300
terms of the square wave
function, we were able to

224
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,940
compute their Fourier series.

225
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,000
And we were able to do this
essentially without having to

226
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,600
evaluate any integrals.

227
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,550
OK.

228
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,290
So I hope you enjoyed this
problem, and I'll

229
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,540
see you next time.

230
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,418
