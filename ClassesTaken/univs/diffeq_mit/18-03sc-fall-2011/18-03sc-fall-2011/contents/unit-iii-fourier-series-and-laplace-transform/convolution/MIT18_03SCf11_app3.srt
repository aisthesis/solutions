00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,280
PROFESSOR: Convolution is a
tricky concept and hard to

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,420
understand.

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,170
But it gives so much insight
that it's worthwhile coming to

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,710
grips with it.

6
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,540
The convolution accumulation
mathlet provides one

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,710
perspective on the convolution
integral.

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,080
I'll explain the applet
using a story.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,060
There's a lake in Iowa with a
stream running into it and a

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,000
stream running out of it.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,560
Farm runoff puts phosphate
into the lake.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,420
The rate of deposition
of the phosphate

13
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,150
varies over the year.

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,550
Most in the summer, none
in the dead of winter.

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,890
Suppose the farm is new and that
t equals 0, there is no

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,550
phosphate in the lake.

17
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,780
This is called rest initial
conditions.

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,700
The question is, how much
phosphate is there in the lake

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,860
at some later time, say t.

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,290
This will be an accumulation of
contributions from earlier

21
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,060
times, but the earlier
contributions will have

22
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,650
decayed somewhat by time t.

23
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,710
We can visualize this process
using the convolution

24
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,780
accumulation mathlet.

25
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,100
I'll set it up to model
what we're looking at.

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,310
The signal f of t is the
rate of input of

27
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,290
phosphate into the lake.

28
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,450
And I will model it by the
menu item f of t is

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,810
1 plus cosine bt.

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,765
You can see it drawn in the
lower graphing window here.

31
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:29,300

32
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,620
A certain proportion of the
phosphate in the lake leaves

33
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,200
it during each unit of time.

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,710
This results in an exponential
decay of each contribution.

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,420
This decay profile is called the
weight function, denoted

36
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,390
here by g of t.

37
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,740
And I will select the weight
function, giving exponential

38
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,320
decay e to the minus at.

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,110

40
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,970
Now let's see what happens
if I let a small

41
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,620
amount of time elapse.

42
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,990
How small?

43
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,630
Well I can select that by
picking the step size.

44
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,479
And I will select a step
size of one eighth.

45
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,810
So now let's let a little
bit of time elapse.

46
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,060
Say, amount of time
of one eighth.

47
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,605
If I click on the time
slider at one

48
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,650
eighth, I get this picture.

49
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,560
T equals 0 happens to occur at
mid-summer, so that the signal

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,090
has a value of 2 in kilograms
per unit time.

51
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:36,040
This phosphate decays away as
water comes into the lake and

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,360
carries it off according
to the weight function.

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,080
And this is indicated by the
exponential decay function

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,330
here in the bottom window.

55
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,790

56
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,940
The weight function is a rate.

57
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,220
It needs to get multiplied by
the step size before it gives

58
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,450
an actual amount of phosphate
in the lake.

59
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,440
The step size is one eighth, and
the product is the signal,

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,430
the value of the signal at t
equals 0, that's 2, times the

61
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,570
weight function, that's the
exponential decay, times the

62
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,360
step size, which
is one eighth.

63
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,470
So that gives all together
one quarter times

64
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,380
that exponential decay.

65
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,220
And you see that drawn in the
top graphing window here, the

66
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,590
value near t equals 0 is a
quarter and it decays away

67
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,880
exponentially.

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,370
Now let's move on to the
next time interval.

69
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,450
I'll click here, and you
see what happens.

70
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,800
The signal is now a little
bit less and the time is

71
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,180
a little bit later.

72
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,400
So the weight function is scaled
and shifted a little

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,980
bit differently in this bottom
graphing window.

74
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,830
It gets multiplied by the step
size one eighth again, and

75
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,410
laid down on top of the graph of
the phosphate arising from

76
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,450
the first time interval.

77
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,000
So the sum of those two is a
record of the phosphate in the

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,370
lake arising from these first
two time intervals as it

79
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,070
decays away in later time.

80
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,050
This process continues.

81
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,060
You can see the next few steps
by clicking them up.

82
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,200
Here's the effect of the third
time interval as it decays

83
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,170
away, but laid down on top of
the preceding contributions to

84
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,530
the lake, and so on.

85
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,170
Or I animate the entire process
and watch the thing

86
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,925
evolve as time increases.

87
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:44,310

88
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,990
So you can see, the effect is
a steady state is reached

89
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,410
after a while, you get a
sinusoidal total amount of

90
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,950
phosphate in the lake.

91
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,040
It's delayed a little
bit from the peak.

92
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,790
The maximum amount of phosphate
in the lake occurs a

93
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,040
little after mid-summer.

94
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,670

95
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,820
Now imagine shrinking
the step size.

96
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,240
In the limit, as the step size
goes to 0, this process is

97
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,940
described by the convolution
integral.

98
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,140
At time t, all the contributions
from time 0 to

99
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,560
time t are present.

100
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,040
And so we're going to take
an integral from u equals

101
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,230
0 to u equals t.

102
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,650
The contribution from time u
decays by the factor of g of t

103
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,970
minus u by time t.

104
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:45,040
So the contribution from between
time u and time u plus

105
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,620
tu is given by the product f
of u, the signal of time u,

106
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,030
times g of t minus u, the weight
function evaluated at t

107
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,010
minus u, times du.

108
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,890

109
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,310
And the integral of this
differential, from u equals 0

110
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,030
to u equals t, is the amount
of phosphate in the

111
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,570
lake at time t.

112
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,810
And it's given by the
convolution integral.

113
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,020
This system is modeled by a
differential equation, namely

114
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,600
dx dt plus ax equals f of t.

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:26,985
The weight function of the
operator dx dt plus ax is e to

116
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:29,290
the minus at.

117
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,585
And the solution to the
differential equation with

118
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:34,210
rest initial conditions is
given by the convolution

119
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,260
integral of the input signal
with the weight function.

120
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,000
This statement is a general fact
for LTI operators, not

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,340
just first order operators.

122
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,421
