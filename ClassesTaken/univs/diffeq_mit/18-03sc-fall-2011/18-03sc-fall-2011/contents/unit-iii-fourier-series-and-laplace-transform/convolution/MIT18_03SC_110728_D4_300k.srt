00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,058

2
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:07,080
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,240
Welcome back.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,570
In this problem, I'd like to
take a look at convolution and

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,450
Green's formula.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,560
Specifically, for part one,
we're just asked to compute

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,120
the convolution of
t with itself, t.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,700
In the second part, we're
asked to compute the

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,100
convolution of e to the
minus kt with another

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,590
exponential, e to the at.

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,030
And then in part B, we're to use
the result from part A as

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,580
well as Green's formula
to solve x dot plus kx

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,370
equals e to the at.

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,870
And specifically, we're
interested in the rest initial

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,910
condition solution
to this formula.

16
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,260
OK.

17
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,610
So I'll let you think about this
problem, and I'll be back

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,860
in a minute.

19
00:00:48,860 --> 00:01:01,774

20
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:02,880
Hi, everyone.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,280
Welcome back.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,450
OK, so for part one, we're
asked to compute the

23
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,890
convolution of two functions,
t with itself--

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,780
and I'll just quickly write
down the formula for

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,430
convolution.

26
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,990
So if I have two functions, f
and g, then the convolution is

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:26,680
defined as, in this case, the
integral from zero to t of f,

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,660
so the function f evaluated at,
we're going to use tau as

29
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,750
the integration variable,
multiply by g, t

30
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,260
minus tau, d tau.

31
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,260
So notice how the variable
t appears in two

32
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,370
places in this formula.

33
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,900
It appears in one place in the
argument of g, and it appears

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,790
in the bound of integration.

35
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,900
Meanwhile, tau is the variable
we're integrating over, and

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:02,170
tau appears in two places as
well, one in f and one in g.

37
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,220
So if we're interested in t
convolved with t, we have the

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:18,760
integral from zero to t of
tau times t minus tau.

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,930
So notice how f is just t and g
is t, so when we insert tau

40
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,910
and t minus tau into the
function, we end up just

41
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,910
getting tau times t
minus tau, d tau.

42
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,170

43
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,860
And just expanding this out, we
have t times tau minus tau

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,230
squared, d tau.

45
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,900
So in the integral, the variable
t always appears just

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,150
as a constant.

47
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,820

48
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,990
So in this case, we have t,
tau integrated becomes t

49
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,420
squared over 2.

50
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,830
When I integrate from zero to
t, tau squared integrates to

51
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:11,420
1/3 t cubed, and zero
drops out from the

52
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,970
other end of the integral.

53
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:20,240
So we end up with t cubed, 1/2
minus 1/3, which is equal to

54
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,630
1/6 t cubed.

55
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,180
So there's the answer
we're looking for.

56
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,850
For part B, or for question
two, again we have another

57
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,100
computation to do.

58
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,410

59
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,900
So we have more integrals
to work out.

60
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,570

61
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,905
And in this case, it's
two exponentials.

62
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:43,810

63
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,650
So we have zero to t.

64
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,850
The first one is going
to be e to the k tau.

65
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,650

66
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,580
And the second one is e to
the at minus tau, d tau.

67
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,530

68
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,120
So we can just expand things
out, and I get e to the at

69
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:25,200
times e to the minus a plus
k tau d tau, zero to t.

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,870
And again, because t is just
a dummy variable in this

71
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,460
integral, we're not integrating
over t, I can just

72
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,800
think of e to the at
as a constant.

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,740
So I'm really just integrating
the function e to the minus a

74
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,160
plus k tau.

75
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,970

76
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:49,870
And when I integrate this
function, I get 1 over minus a

77
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:57,170
plus k, e to the minus a plus
k, tau evaluated at the

78
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,010
bounds, zero and t.

79
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:08,460

80
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,424
So the negative sign here
just flips the bounds.

81
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:13,930
So we have a plus k.

82
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,650

83
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:23,910
Substituting in zero just
gives us 1, and then

84
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,273
substituting in t gives us
e to the minus a plus kt.

85
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:31,480

86
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,978
And I can expand out, multiply
out, e to the at.

87
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:37,714

88
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:44,930
And when the dust settles, we
have e to the at minus e to

89
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,180
the minus kt.

90
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,100

91
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,640
So this is just the computation
of the convolution

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,510
e to the minus kt and e to at.

93
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,510
So note now if, for example, k
were to equal negative a, we

94
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,750
would have zero in
the denominator

95
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,530
and zero on the numerator.

96
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,250
So one way to compute the
special k case when k is equal

97
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,050
to negative a is to use
L'Hopital's Rule and

98
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,120
differentiate the top
and the bottom.

99
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,600
For example, with
respect to k.

100
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,720

101
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,780
Another alternative way of
computing the special case

102
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:34,790
when a is equal to negative k is
just to plug in e to the k,

103
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,510
and then just work out this
integral, and you'll obtain a

104
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,760
different answer.

105
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,990

106
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,770
And now lastly, for part B,
we're interested in the

107
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:51,430
differential equation x dot plus
kx equals e to the at.

108
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,480
And we're interested in
finding the particular

109
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,570
solution that has rest
initial conditions.

110
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,070
So for example, x of zero
is equal to zero.

111
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,240

112
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
And we want to use
Green's formula.

113
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,290
So just recall that there's the
impulse response formula

114
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,810
for the weight function w,
which solves the same

115
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,940
differential equation, but with
the delta function on the

116
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,190
right hand side.

117
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,290

118
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:33,740
And w, in this case, as we've
seen in lecture, is actually e

119
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,310
to the negative kt when t is
bigger than zero, and at zero

120
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,560
when t is less than zero.

121
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,720

122
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,250
So notice how e to the minus
kt is exactly the function

123
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,850
that we convolved in part A.
Specifically, we convolved it

124
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,880
with e to the at.

125
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,280
So for example, Green's
formula says that the

126
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,650
particular solution that has
rest initial conditions is

127
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,780
going to be the wave function
convolved with the right hand

128
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,040
side of the differential
equation, e to at.

129
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,790
In this case, on the domain
of integration for the

130
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,280
convolution, w is just
e to the minus kt.

131
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,580

132
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,350
So we have e to the minus kt
convolved with e to the at.

133
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,270
So Green's formula gives
us the solution to this

134
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,620
differential equation, which has
rest initial conditions.

135
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,530
And specifically--

136
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,220
we've already worked this out
from part A, so I can just

137
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,561
write down what the answer is.

138
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:50,525
It's 1 over a plus k, e to the
at, minus e to the minus kt.

139
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:55,630

140
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,370
And just as a quick check to
make sure that we've done

141
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,850
everything correctly, we can
plug in t equals zero.

142
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,800
And when t equals zero,
we have 1 minus 1,

143
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,560
which gives us zero.

144
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,860
So indeed, this x is the
solution to this differential

145
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,285
equation, which has rest
initial conditions.

146
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:13,830

147
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,550
I'd just like to conclude
this problem.

148
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,180
Quick recap.

149
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,880
We worked out several
convolutions, and specifically

150
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,630
we were able to use Green's
formula in addition to the

151
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,360
convolution that we worked out
to compute the solution with

152
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,220
rest initial conditions
to an ODE.

153
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,110
Moreover, Green's function is
very useful because notice how

154
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,260
we could have computed the
convolution for any right hand

155
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,170
side function here.

156
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,390
So in some sense, we're able
to generalize and find

157
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,750
solutions to differential
equations which have arbitrary

158
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,550
right hand side forcings, not
just sines and cosines,

159
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,820
periodic functions, or other
simple functions which we've

160
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,410
been looking at in the past.

161
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,560
So I'd like to conclude here,
and I'll see you next time.

162
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,810
