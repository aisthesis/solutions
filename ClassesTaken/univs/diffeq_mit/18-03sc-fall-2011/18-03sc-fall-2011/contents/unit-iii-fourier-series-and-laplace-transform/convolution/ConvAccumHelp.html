          accumulation of the convolution integral can be controlled either by 
          clicking the [&gt;&gt;] button to animate, or by clicking on the time 
          slider to pick a time value u. The yellow curve represents the convolution 
          f(t)*g(t) up to time <br>
          u; the top cyan curve represents the convolution of the weight g(t) 
          with a signal which is f(t) for t&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;u and zero for t&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;u; 
          it cuts off at time t&nbsp;=&nbsp;u.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To 
          understand this visual, select f(t)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;cos(bt) 
          and g(t)&nbsp;=&nbsp;e<sup>-at</sup>. We have a model of farm runoff 
          into a lake. It varies seasonally, and the rate at which phosphates, 
          say, enter the lake is given by f(t). These chemicals are washed out 
          of the lake, as well, at a rate proportional to the amount in the lake. Thus, of every kilogram in the lake at time u, g(t-u) kilograms remains 
          in the lake at time t, i.e. time t&nbsp;-&nbsp;u later. It is assumed
          that at t&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 the phosphate load is zero ('rest initial 
          conditions').</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Select 
        stepsize 1/4 and click on the animate key [>>]. An animation shows the 
        weight function g(t), in the lower screen in cyan, shifting progressively 
        to the right, multiplied at each stage by the value of the signal for 
        the appropriate value of u. The representation of the signal turns green 
        as this process proceeds. These blue graphs in the lower window are multiplied 
        by 1/4 (the stepsize) and laid down on top of what has been contributed 
        already, for smaller values of u. 
        <p>
          The upper graph displays the cumulative total amount of phosphate in 
          the lake. The yellow curve shows this accumulation: it is the convolution 
          f(t)*g(t). With u&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, if you follow the yellow curve and 
          then the top blue curve, you are tracing out the amount of phosphate 
          in the lake resulting from runoff which proceeds at the rate f(t) for 
          t&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;u but is then reduced to zero for t&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;u.</p>
