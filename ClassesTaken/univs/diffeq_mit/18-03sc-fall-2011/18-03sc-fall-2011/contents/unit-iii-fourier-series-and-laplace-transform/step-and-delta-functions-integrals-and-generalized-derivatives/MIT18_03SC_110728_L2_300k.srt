1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,071

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,420
PROFESSOR: So in this
recitation, we're going to

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,660
look at step and delta
functions, integration and

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,350
generalized derivatives.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,550
So the first part, you're asked
to compute the integral

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,990
from zero minus to
infinity delta t

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,730
exponential t squared dt.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,290
The second one is from zero
minus to infinity delta t

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,690
minus 2 exponential of t
squared sine t cos 2t.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,030
The third one is zero plus to
infinity delta t exponential

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,170
of squared dt.

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,640
So know that it's the same as
a, except that the bounds of

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,320
integration changed.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,880
The second part, we're asked
to define the generalized

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,470
derivatives of these two
functions, where u here is

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,280
just a step function that
you saw before.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,390
So it's 3ut minus 2ut minus 1.

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,080
And the second one is t squared
for t is negative and

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,370
exponential of minus
t for t positive.

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,420
So why don't you pause the video
and work through this

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,890
example, and I'll
be right back.

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:08,520

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,930
Welcome back.

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,570
So let's compute
the first one.

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,570

26
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:23,900
Zero minus infinity delta t
exponential t squared dt.

27
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,480
So just to remind you, the delta
function is everywhere

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,700
zero except at the
value of zero.

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,130
And we represent it
with an arrow.

30
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,170
And the integral of the delta
would be 1 from minus infinity

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,360
to plus infinity.

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,760
In this integral, we're
integrating from zero minus to

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,700
infinity, which means that the
zero is included in our

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,390
interval from zero minus
to infinity.

35
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,520
Therefore, this integral is
basically assigning the value

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,860
to this function exponential
t squared.

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,045
And the value that it's
assigning to it is the value

38
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:00,100
it would take at t equals
to zero where

39
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,110
the delta is non-zero.

40
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,040
So really clearly, this is
just exponential of zero.

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,120
And it gives us 1.

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,090
For the second integral, it
goes from zero minus to

43
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,800
infinity, delta t minus
2 exponential, a more

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,200
complicated function, t
squared sine t cos 2t.

45
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,350
So now, let's represent this
delta function here.

46
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,050
So this is just our zero axis.

47
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,400
And the delta here is zero
everywhere except at 2 where

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,530
we would represent it,
again, with an arrow

49
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,750
at 2 amplitude 1.

50
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,900
So this delta is zero everywhere
except at 2 where

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,920
it would assign the value to the
function next do it at the

52
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,390
value t equals to 2.

53
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,800
So really this integration gives
us just the value of

54
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:06,600
this function at t equal
2, so 4 sine 2 cos 4.

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,970
And here, the key was that
again, this interval of

56
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,580
integration from zero minus to
infinity and clearly includes

57
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,450
the value at which delta
function is non-zero.

58
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,710
So for the last one, we return
to our first integral except

59
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,020
that now we are changing the
bounds of integration to zero

60
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,270
plus to infinity.

61
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,730

62
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,240
So now, if I do our presentation
of the delta

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,760
function that we're dealing
with, so delta centered at 1

64
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,950
and the interval of integration,
we have an open

65
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,470
interval now that does not
include the value at which

66
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,710
delta is non-equal to zero.

67
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:51,050
So everywhere this function
would just be assigned its

68
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,070
value at, it'd just be
multiplied by the function

69
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,930
that is zero.

70
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,215
And so basically, it's like
multiplying this function by

71
00:03:58,215 --> 00:04:00,540
zero, and it just
gives us zero.

72
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,790
It's like the delta fell
off of our interval of

73
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,500
integration, so we're just left
with a zero function.

74
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,850
So let's move to the
second part.

75
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,860

76
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,450
The second part asked us to find
a generalized derivative

77
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:26,680
to f of t equals 3u of t
minus 2u of t minus 1.

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,840
So just to remind you here of
what u of t's are, just want

79
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,950
to sketch a few things.

80
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,760
So first, u of t is just the
step function that would be

81
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,810
zero everywhere and would
take the value 1 for

82
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,270
t larger than zero.

83
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,740
So this first part here would
just be non-zero for

84
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,070
t larger than zero.

85
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,470
Instead of being assigned
value 1, it's just the

86
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,830
assigned value 3 because we're
multiplying the u of t by 3.

87
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,810
So this first part would
look like this.

88
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,640
The second part here would be
u shifted by minus 1, which

89
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,630
means that u is zero everywhere
for t less than 1.

90
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,550
So we would have a zero
function here.

91
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,270
So let me just do that.

92
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,100
But it should be on the
same axis and 1 for

93
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,270
t larger than 1.

94
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,770
But here, we're multiplying
it by factor minus 2.

95
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:29,910
So really, what we have is
another u function that is

96
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,070
shifted down 2 minus 2.

97
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,520
So the sum of these two
contributions is zero for t

98
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,370
negative takes the value of 3
for t between zero and 1, and

99
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:51,670
the value 1, 3 minus 2,
for t larger than 1.

100
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,240
So clearly here, we have
discontinuities at t equals to

101
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,980
zero and t equals to 1.

102
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,320
So let's just write down
the derivative.

103
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,260
The generalized derivative here
would lead us first to

104
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,140
compute the derivatives where
the function is continuous.

105
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,290
So for minus infinity to zero,
it's a constant, derivative

106
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,290
would be zero.

107
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,560
Between zero and 1,
it's constant,

108
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,890
derivative would be zero.

109
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,360
And from 1 to infinity, it
would also give us zero.

110
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,010
So we would have a zero
contribution from the

111
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,390
continuous part of the function,
if you wish.

112
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,060
But we still need to account
for the discontinuities.

113
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,790
So at zero, we have a
jump from zero to 3.

114
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,070
And that we learned can be
written down as a delta

115
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,950
function of magnitude
3 centered at zero.

116
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,410
After that, we have
another jump.

117
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,790
Now, it's from 3 to 1.

118
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,660
So it's a jump of minus 2
amplitude centered at 1.

119
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,800
So here, we can also do that
with the delta, but we just

120
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,290
need also to shift it by minus
1 to show clearly that the

121
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,420
jump occurs at 1 and multiply
this by minus 2 to show the

122
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,180
amplitude of the jump down.

123
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,730
So if we were now to represent
this f prime, basically, the

124
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,650
regular part is zero.

125
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,800
So there's nothing
to write down

126
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,460
except just a zero function.

127
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,210
And these discontinuities that
I'm just going to represent on

128
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,670
the graph would be the delta
function centered at zero

129
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:22,146
magnitude 3 and delta function
centered around 1 of

130
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:24,950
magnitude minus 2.

131
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,200
And the rest would just
be the zero function.

132
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:35,110
So that would be f
prime, f of t.

133
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:43,280
So for the second one that we
were given, it's a function f

134
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,370
of t that takes the value t
squared for t negative and

135
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:56,880
exponential minus t
for t positive.

136
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,330
So a quick sketch here tells
that this function looks like

137
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,110
this, an exponential minus
t for t positive taking

138
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,040
a value here 1.

139
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,660
So clearly, there is a jump
here, discontinuity.

140
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,840
So how do we go about computing
this generalized

141
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,420
derivative?

142
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,210
So let's look again at
the continuous parts.

143
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,130
So from minus infinity to zero,
we're dealing with just

144
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,220
the t squared.

145
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,600
So the derivative is just 2t.

146
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,700

147
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,110
For t between zero and infinity,
we're just dealing

148
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,820
with exponential minus t.

149
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,539
So that's minus exponential
minus t.

150
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,650
But we need to account for the
discontinuity the jump of

151
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,870
amplitude, 1 at zero.

152
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,362
So as we saw before, this
can just be modeled

153
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:46,780
with a delta function.

154
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,380
And if we were to represent this
function, then we would

155
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:57,240
just need to add the delta
function of magnitude 1 here

156
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,540
and then just sketch 2t, for
example, and then minus

157
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,490
exponential of minus 2t.

158
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,460
That would give us something
like that.

159
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,550
And that ends the problem
for today.

160
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,660
And the key point here were
just to learn how to

161
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,700
manipulate the step function
and how to use the delta

162
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,210
function when you compute
your integrals.

163
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,720
And be careful with the
bounds of integration.

164
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,818
