        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>This 
          Mathlet illustrates the relationship between the amplitude response 
          as a function of frequency and the pole diagram of the transfer function, 
          using as an example a system, like the spring/mass/dashpot system driven 
          <br>
          by through the spring, that is controlled by the differential equation 
          shown at the top.</strong></font></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Grab 
          the [k] slider or the [b] slider to set these system parameters.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Grab 
          the [&omega;] slider to set the circular frequency of the input signal 
          cos(&omega;t).</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          graph at upper right shows the amplitude of the sinusoidal response 
          as a function of the input circular frequency. A yellow strut marks 
          the chosen input frequency.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          window at lower right shows a part of the complex plane. The real axis 
          is green, the imaginary axis yellow.<br>
          Red diamonds mark the roots of the characteristic polynomial, which 
          in this configuration are the poles of the transfer function. Yellow 
          diamonds mark the complex numbers &plusmn;i&omega;.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          window at left shows the graph of the modulus of the transfer function, 
          in shades of blue-green. Grey lines edge the same portion of the complex 
          plane as is shown in the lower right window, and the real and imaginary 
          axes are shown in green and yellow. Rectangles above these axes are 
          bordered in the same color. The poles of the transfer function are marked 
          by red diamonds and surmounted by vertical red arrows. The intersection 
          of the plane above the imaginary axis with the graph of the modulus 
          of the transfer function is marked by a yellow curve. Yellow diamonds 
          mark the complex numbers &plusmn;i&omega;, and yellow struts connect 
          them to the graph of the transfer function.</font></strong></p>
        <p><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
          three-dimensional diagram can be rotated by dragging the cursor across 
          that window. Buttons below the graph set the view to a standard top 
          view or side view.</font></strong></p>
