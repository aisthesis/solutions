00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,390

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,590
PROFESSOR: Welcome.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,400
In this session, we're going to
examine pole diagrams. So

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,000
let's consider a pole diagram
for the linear time

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,270
independent systems of the
form bdy equals f.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,390
So here, we have a few pole
diagrams to examine with the

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,580
poles marked with
the red crosses.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,620
The axes are imaginary axis
and the real axis.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,440
And the questions are list all
the stable systems. Choose the

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,550
systems with the
fastest decay.

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,970
And last, choose fastest decay
without oscillation.

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,700
So you have to think of how to
interpret these diagrams and

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,140
what are the meanings of the
position of the different

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,810
poles to address these
questions.

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,640
So pause the video.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,670
Take a few minutes.

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,920
And I'll be right back.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:59,850

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,570
Welcome back.

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,200
So the first question asks
us to list all the stable

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,510
systems. So if you recall, all
the stable systems would be

22
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,810
the ones for which the
real part of the

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,940
pole are all negative.

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:18,620
So if we have all the poles with
real part negative, we

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,160
would have a stable system for
which the solution after a

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,060
long time would decay,
basically.

27
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,320
It would be transient.

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,140
So here, if we look at our pole
diagrams, we have diagram

29
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,520
B for which the real part
of the two poles are

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,240
minus 3 and minus 2.

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,650
So this would definitely
generate a decaying

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,090
exponential, exponential minus
2t, exponential minus 3t type

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,650
function at large time
for this system.

34
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,310
In A, we have a minus
1 and a 1.

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,100
So the real part here would
give us a decay, an

36
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,660
exponential decay, exponential
minus t.

37
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,870
But we would have here a term
that will diverge with

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,770
exponential t.

39
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,220
So this would have basically
behavior a long time that

40
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,450
diverges and doesn't go to 0.

41
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,740
So this would not basically
be a stable system.

42
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,970
For C, we have all the
real parts negative.

43
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,730
So we're in the stable case.

44
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,600
For D, we also have the same.

45
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,110
All the real parts
are negative.

46
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,620
So these are imaginary,
3i minus 2 plus 3i.

47
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,540
So both of them have also
negative real parts.

48
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,290
Everything is on the left
side of the plane.

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,990
Same thing for E. And for F,
we're right on the imaginary

50
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,520
axis, which means that we can't
tell if it's going to be

51
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,700
an exponential.

52
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,180
It's not going to be an
exponential decay or growth at

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,930
this point.

54
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:48,870
So to answer the first question,
the stable systems

55
00:02:48,870 --> 00:03:02,110
would be B, C, D, E,
and that's it.

56
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,540
So now, for the second part,
choose the system with the

57
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,920
fastest decay.

58
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,040
So here, again, as we just
saw, the real part of the

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,290
poles gives us the speed
at which the

60
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,010
system is going to decay.

61
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:22,605
And so we have to look for a
system that has its pole on

62
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:25,860
the rightmost part
of the plane.

63
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,900
So for example, if we restrict
ourselves here, the fastest

64
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,820
decay here is going to be
governed by the rightmost

65
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,290
pole, so exponential minus 2t
that we need to examine.

66
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,820
Here, we have an exponential
minus 3t decay time.

67
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,320
Here, we would have an
exponential minus t decay.

68
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,190
Here, we would have something
a little bit--

69
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,870
minus 0.5t.

70
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,750
And here, again, this is
not stable system.

71
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,700
We did decay at large time.

72
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,120
So which of the system has
the fastest decay?

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,920
We would need to select the one
with the rightmost pole

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,810
that is the most on the left.

75
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,990
So we would need to compare this
minus 2, with this minus

76
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,860
3, with this minus 1,
with this minus 0.5.

77
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,430
And from all these poles, the
one that has the minus 3 here

78
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,410
would be the one that would
be decaying the fastest.

79
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:31,810
So we would have system
C decaying as

80
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,120
exponential minus 3t.

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,000
And I'm going to just write
down the others.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,920
And these would be the dominant
terms that would

83
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,870
basically subscribe the
behavior at large t.

84
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:50,220
So this is the fastest. For our
system B, which is not the

85
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,020
fastest, I'm just going to write
it, it's going to be

86
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,630
dominated by a minus 2t.

87
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:04,280
For the system D, it would be
dominated by a minus 1t.

88
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:12,650
For the system E, it would be
dominated by the minus 0.5t.

89
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,890
So the fastest decay would
definitely be system C.

90
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,250
So the last question, choose
the fastest decay without

91
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,340
oscillations.

92
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,050
So now, we need to pay attention
to whether the poles

93
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,930
are on the imaginary axis, on
the real axis, or somewhere in

94
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,870
the middle.

95
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,920
So let's again, examine
only the stable cases.

96
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,230
So here, the two poles
are in the real axis.

97
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,760
So it's going to give us a
behavior that is only pure

98
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,650
decay, exponential decay,
exponential minus 2t,

99
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,030
exponential minus 3t with
no oscillation.

100
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,920
Because basically, these two
people don't have any

101
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,230
imaginary parts.

102
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,530
Here, we have a term in
exponential minus 3t.

103
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,690
But we would have a term that
would show oscillations with

104
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,130
the circular frequencies of 3.

105
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,620
So you would have an exponential
minus 3t cosine 3t

106
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,410
plus exponential minus 3t
sine 3t, for example.

107
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,720
So here, we would have a system
that shows oscillation.

108
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,530
So we don't want that.

109
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,480
For this case, that
would be similar.

110
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,440
So you see the pattern.

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,400
Here, we have an exponential
decay.

112
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,720
Here, we would have decaying
oscillations.

113
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,500
So there is oscillations.

114
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,910
Same thing here.

115
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,410
And so we're left with only
system B, which basically does

116
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,210
not show any oscillation but
only an exponential decay.

117
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:34,720

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,970
Pure decay.

119
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,750

120
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,310
And it's dominated by the
exponential minus 2t without

121
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,560
oscillations.

122
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,810

123
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,830
So that ends this first
part of the problem.

124
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,070
I'm just going to take a minute
and come back to show

125
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,320
you the second part
of the problem.

126
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,240

127
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,670
Welcome back for the second
part of the problem.

128
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,430
So here, another pole diagram
that we're going to label J

129
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,050
for this system.

130
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,370
And the poles are basically
here, 0.5 plus

131
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,940
4i, 0.5 minus 4i.

132
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,330
And then here, we have
almost a minus 3.

133
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,690
And here, it would
be a minus 4.

134
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,460
So the question is to consider
now the previous system we

135
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,590
had, p of dy equals f of t.

136
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,510
But now, with f of t equals f0
cos omega t, and omega, the

137
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,480
circular frequency going
between one and five.

138
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,810
And the question is for which
values of omega do we have the

139
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,000
largest response from
the system G?

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,230
So basically, we're looking at
phenomenon of resonance where

141
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,800
we want to find the frequency
omega for which the response

142
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,700
of the system is going to be
the biggest. So I give you

143
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,040
just a few minutes, and
we'll be right back.

144
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:12,140

145
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,980
Welcome back for this
second part.

146
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:19,120
So here, if you recall, the
amplitude response from the

147
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,870
previous recitations, the
amplitude is governed by 1

148
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,300
over the characteristic
polynomial

149
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,640
evaluated at i omega.

150
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,150
Where does i omega come from?

151
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,130
If you recall, it
comes from the

152
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,510
exponential response formula.

153
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,009
Because on the right-hand side
here, we have a cosine omega

154
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:37,964
t, then we complexify
exponential and we get, et

155
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:40,530
cetera, to get the amplitude
response.

156
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,540
So the amplitude is going to be
the largest for basically

157
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,200
values of i omega that are the
closest to the poles of the

158
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,640
polynomial to the poles
of this function.

159
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,300

160
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,500
Basically, the poles of the 1
over characteristic polynomial

161
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,700
is going to give us the 1 over
0, which will give an

162
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,400
amplitude response that
goes to infinity,

163
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,420
so the largest response.

164
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,280
So we want to choose our
frequency, i omega.

165
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,810
Basically, we want to look at
this diagram and look at the

166
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,950
poles that are the closest to
the values that are going to

167
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,100
give us p of s equals to 0.

168
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,660
And this is basically diagrammed
that gives us the

169
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,630
pole of this 1 over p.

170
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,000
And so we want to choose a value
for i omega, which will

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,990
be on the imaginary axis, that
is the closest to one

172
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,830
of these two poles.

173
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,370
Given that we work with positive
frequencies, we would

174
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:46,460
want, for example, to choose
i omega equals i4.

175
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,040
So it would be here, or just
omega equals to 4.

176
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,630
And this value of omega would
get us very close to this

177
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,970
pole, which would mean then
that we are 1 over a very

178
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,730
small number, which means that
the amplitude response will be

179
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,580
the biggest. So that's the look
behind the resonance and

180
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,140
looking at, again, the
phenomenon of the resonance

181
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,430
from the pole diagram
perspective and with the idea

182
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,480
of the use of the laplace
transform

183
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,810
behind the whole technique.

184
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,360
So that ends this session.

185
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,470
And the goal was really to learn
to interpret the meaning

186
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,140
of the poles in the pole diagram
and how do the polls

187
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,390
give us an idea inside on
the behavior of the

188
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,640
system on the long term.

189
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,747
