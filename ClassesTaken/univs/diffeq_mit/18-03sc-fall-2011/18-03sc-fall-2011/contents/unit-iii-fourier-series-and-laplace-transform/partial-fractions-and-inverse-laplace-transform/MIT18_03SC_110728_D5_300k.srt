1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,010
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,260
So today we're going to take a
look at a problem with partial

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,880
fractions, and specifically
how to use these partial

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,379
fractions to compute
Laplace inverses.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,360
So just as a warm-up, we're
asked to recall what the

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,300
formula is for the Laplace
transform of f prime, in terms

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,690
of the Laplace transform of f.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,900
In the second part, we're asked
to find the inverse

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,070
Laplace transform for three
different functions.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,670
The first one is 1 over s
squared minus 4, s squared

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,070
divided by s squared plus 4, e
to the minus 5s divided by s

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,800
square minus 4.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,750
And notice how none of these
functions appear in the

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,930
look-up table for Laplace
transform.

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,750
So in each case, we have to
use partial fractions to

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,800
convert it or massage these
functions into something which

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,820
we do know the Laplace transform
inverse for.

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,390
And then lastly, for the third
problem we're asked to write

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,450
down the partial fraction
decomposition of this

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,260
function, 1 over s squared times
s squared plus 4 times s

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,430
plus 1 times s plus 3.

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,480
And specifically, when we
do the partial fraction

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,460
decomposition, we're just
going to leave the

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,340
undetermined coefficients
unknown.

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,480
We're not actually going
to solve for them.

27
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:22,830
OK?

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,310
So I'll let you think
about this problem.

29
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,560
And I'll be back in a moment.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:35,521

31
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:36,640
Hi everyone.

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,040
Welcome back.

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,300
OK.

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,010
So for part one, we're just
asked to recall the Laplace

35
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,410
transform of f prime in terms of
the Laplace transform of f.

36
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:55,160
So the Laplace transform of f
prime we can write down as s

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,310
times the Laplace transform of
F, which I'll use capital F,

38
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:06,040
minus f evaluated at the lower
bound of the Laplace transform

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,340
integral, which in this case
is just zero minus.

40
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:10,720
OK.

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,900
So this is just part one.

42
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,690
This is a warm-up problem.

43
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,570
For part two, we're asked to
find the inverse Laplace

44
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,540
transform for three different
functions.

45
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,480
The first one is 1 over
s squared minus 4.

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,540
And we see here that we can
factor the denominator into

47
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,960
one over s minus 2 times 1 over
s plus 2, which means

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,820
that we can use a partial
fraction decomposition which

49
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,910
has the form of A divided
by s minus 2 plus B

50
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,220
divided by s plus 2.

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,460

52
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,140
And then we need to solve for
the coefficients A and B.

53
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,660
So one way to solve for the
coefficients A and B is just

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,830
to multiply both sides of this
equation through by the

55
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,060
factors s minus 2
and s plus 2.

56
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,740
We can then plug in values of
s and solve for A and B.

57
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,750
There's another way, which is
sometimes referred to a

58
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,920
cover-up method.

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,550
And in this case, what we do is
we pick, for example, say

60
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,310
one of the places where the
denominator blows out.

61
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,630
So for example, if we look at
this factor s minus 2, this

62
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,260
factor diverges when
s approaches 2.

63
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,120
So then what we do is we go back
to our original function,

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,500
we cover up the term s minus 2
where it diverges, and then in

65
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,250
the remaining term, we plug in
the value of s, which causes

66
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,570
the factor s minus
2 to diverge.

67
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,940
So in this case, s minus
2 diverges at 2.

68
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,560
So we would cover this factor
up and then plug in

69
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,440
s is equal to 2.

70
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,320
And this would give us the
value of A. So for this

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:04,760
problem, A is equal to 1 over
2 plus 2, which is just 1/4.

72
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,530
For B, we look at plugging
in s equals negative 2.

73
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,600
So we cover up the factor
that diverges in

74
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,720
the original function.

75
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,339
Plugging in s equals negative
2 gives me negative 2 minus

76
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,720
negative 2.

77
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,970
So B is just negative 4.

78
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,070

79
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:30,650
So this function is 1/4 1
over s minus 2 minus 1/4

80
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,160
1 over s plus 2.

81
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,640
And when we take the inverse
Laplace transform, so the

82
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:46,230
inverse Laplace transform of
1 over s squared minus 4 is

83
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,880
going to be 1/4.

84
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,300
The inverse Laplace transform
of s minus 2 is

85
00:04:51,300 --> 00:05:01,180
e to the plus 2t.

86
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,215
The second factor is negative
1/4 e to the negative 2t.

87
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:08,940

88
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,150
And this concludes the
first problem.

89
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,880
For the second function, we have
s squared divided by s

90
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,810
squared plus 4.

91
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,830
So again, this function's not
in the correct form to use a

92
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,050
Laplace transform
look-up table.

93
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,460
But what we can do is we can
divide long division of

94
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,275
polynomials the numerator
out by the denominator.

95
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:37,000

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:48,440
So when we do that we end up
with 1 minus 4 divided by s

97
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,190
squared plus 4.

98
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,670
So when we take the inverse
Laplace transform of s squared

99
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,930
divided by s squared plus 4,
we're left with the inverse

100
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:07,700
Laplace transform of 1 minus the
inverse Laplace transform

101
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,460
of 4 divided by s
squared plus 4.

102
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,570

103
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,150
And if we use our look-up
table, we know that the

104
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,200
inverse Laplace transform of
1 is the delta function.

105
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,460

106
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,980
Meanwhile, the inverse Laplace
transform of some number

107
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,700
divided by s squared plus
4 looks like, in this

108
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,320
case, sine of 2t.

109
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,890
Now we need a 2 upstairs, so
this is going to give us 2

110
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,100
times sine of 2t.

111
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,440

112
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,160
And I obtain this by noting that
the Laplace transform of

113
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,590
sine omega t is equal to omega
divided by s squared plus

114
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,340
omega squared.

115
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,190
So that's how I went from this
function, this Laplace

116
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:09,050
transform inverse,
to 2 sine 2t.

117
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,520
Lastly, for part three, the
third problem, we're asked for

118
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,540
the inverse Laplace transform
of e to the minus 5s divided

119
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,825
by s squared minus 4.

120
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:22,595

121
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:25,960
Now note that we already know
the inverse Laplace transform

122
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,210
to 1 over s squared minus 4.

123
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,830
In this case, we're just
multiplying 1 over s squared

124
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,430
minus 4 by e to the minus 5s.

125
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,450
So we can use the shift formula
in addition to what we

126
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,820
already computed, the inverse
Laplace transform to 1 over s

127
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,320
squared minus 4,
to compute this

128
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,460
inverse Laplace transform.

129
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,680
So the shift formula says that
we need to multiply by the

130
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,540
step function t minus 5.

131
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,980
So we're shifting with
the step function.

132
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,470
And then what we do is we want
to shift the inverse Laplace

133
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,790
transform of 1 over
s squared minus 4.

134
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,820
So the inverse Laplace transform
to 1 over s squared

135
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,020
minus 4 is 2 t minus 5.

136
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:22,460
So if we shift t by 5, we end up
with 1/4 e to the 2 t minus

137
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:31,320
5 minus 1/4 e to the
minus 2 t minus 5.

138
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,490
So again, just to reiterate,
when we have an exponential e

139
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,799
to the minus, say, 5s and we
already know the inverse

140
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,690
Laplace transform of everything
else, we just

141
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,510
multiply by the step function
u t minus 5, the same shift.

142
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,870
And then wherever we see the
t in the inverse Laplace

143
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,130
transform, we just replace it
with t minus 5, in this case.

144
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,560
OK?

145
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,780
And now lastly, for part three
we're just asked to write down

146
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:09,200
the decomposition for this
very large function, the

147
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,230
partial fraction decomposition
of this large function.

148
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:21,620
So it's s squared times s
squared plus 1 times s plus 1

149
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,870
times s plus 3.

150
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:27,700

151
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,600
Let me just double check.
s squared plus 4.

152
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,280

153
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,040
OK?

154
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,250
And unfortunately this
function's going to be a

155
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,360
little ugly.

156
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,690
We're going to have a constant,
A, divided by s plus

157
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,450
B divided by s squared.

158
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,420
So these first two terms come
from this term right here.

159
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,070
For the squared plus 4 term,
we're going to seek a C

160
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,560
times s plus D--

161
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,360
so we need both factors,
Cs plus D--

162
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,820
divided by s squared plus 4.

163
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,840
We have E divided by s plus 1.

164
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,530

165
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,820
And then plus F divided
by s plus 3.

166
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,420

167
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:28,590
So just to associate each factor
in the partial fraction

168
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,600
decomposition with the original
function, I've just

169
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,120
drawn some arrows.

170
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,480
OK?

171
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,220
And then lastly although I
didn't state this in the

172
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,540
original problem, we can also
just write down the inverse

173
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:47,770
Laplace transform of this entire
mess without actually

174
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,820
determining the constants.

175
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,790
We can just keep the
constants in.

176
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:56,310
So if we wanted to compute the
inverse Laplace transform,

177
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,390
well, it would just be A--

178
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,220
because inverse Laplace
transform of 1 over s is 1--

179
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,250
plus B--

180
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,950
inverse Laplace transform
of s squared is t--

181
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:12,550
plus, now this part has two
terms, Cs divided by s

182
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,810
squared plus 4.

183
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,800
That's going to give us
C times cosine of 2t.

184
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,650
The D divided by s squared plus
4 is going to give us,

185
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,360
well, we need to multiply
upstairs by 2 and divide

186
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,820
downstairs by 2.

187
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,500
So we get D divided
by 2 of sine 2t.

188
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:41,470
This term, E, is going to give
us e times the exponential of

189
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,720
negative t.

190
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,910

191
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:53,670
And then the last term is going
to give us F times e to

192
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,220
the minus 3t.

193
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,470
OK?

194
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,590

195
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,690
So just as a quick wrap-up, in
this problem we've computed

196
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,590
partial fraction

197
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,610
decompositions of several functions.

198
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,030
And the reason we've done this
is because we often end up in

199
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,260
a situation when we want to
solve an ODE using Laplace

200
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,640
transforms where we have some
complicated function and we

201
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,520
need to use partial fraction
decomposition to write down

202
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,370
simpler functions, in which
case we can then use the

203
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,880
Laplace inverse formula on each
of the simpler functions.

204
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,150
OK?

205
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,320
So I'll just conclude here, and
I'll see you next time.

206
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,570
