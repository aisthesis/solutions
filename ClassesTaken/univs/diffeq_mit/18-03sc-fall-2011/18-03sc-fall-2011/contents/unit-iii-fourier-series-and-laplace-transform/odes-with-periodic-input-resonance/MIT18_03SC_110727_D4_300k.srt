00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,181

2
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:06,780
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,470
Welcome back.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,470
So today, I'd like to take a
look at solving a linear ODE

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,630
but with a periodic input.

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,100
And specifically, we're asked
to find one solution of a

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,660
particular solution which is
also the periodic solution of

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,620
the differential equation, x
dot, dot plus 2x dot plus 4x

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,440
equals the square
wave function.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,420
So the square wave function is
a periodic function with

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,590
period 2pi is to find as minus 1
and 1 on the intervals minus

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,310
pi to 0 and 0 to pi.

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,300
And we know that the square
wave function has the

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,820
following Fourier series.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,050
So I'll let you think about
this problem for a moment.

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,300
And I'll come back
in a second.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:58,360

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,670
Hi everyone.

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,150
Welcome back.

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,239
So the reason we've been
studying Fourier series is to

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,070
essentially solve differential
equations with complicated

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,620
forcing inputs on
the right-hand

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,960
side which are periodic.

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,760
And the reason we've been
studying Fourier series is

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,970
because we know that
differential equations with

26
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,340
sines and cosines as forcing
terms on the right-hand side

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,340
are relatively easy to solve.

28
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,900
And we want to be able to solve
the same differential

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,760
equation with a more complicated
periodic function

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,360
on the right-hand side.

31
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:44,850
So the general approach is to
first decompose the right-hand

32
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,230
side into a Fourier series.

33
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:57,580

34
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,570
And this step is essentially
already done for us.

35
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,810
We're told what the
Fourier series is.

36
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:09,889
And what we do is we solve
the ODE, x dot, dot

37
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:14,500
plus 2x dot plus 4x.

38
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,390
And I'm just going to take
one term of the Fourier

39
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,520
series, sine nt.

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,390

41
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,720
So if we know the right-hand
side is a sum of a whole bunch

42
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,010
of sines, what we're going to do
is we're going to solve for

43
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,630
any specific one
of those sines.

44
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,245
So we want to solve this
differential equation.

45
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:36,920

46
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,610
And then, we use
superposition.

47
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,660

48
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,370
So if we know what the solution
is to one sine, nt,

49
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,240
and we know that the right-hand
side forcing is a

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,670
sum of many sine nt's with
appropriate weight factors,

51
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:05,240
then we can use superposition to
construct a final solution.

52
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,180

53
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,220
So this is the method to
attack this problem.

54
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,180
So we were given step one, and
we want to solve step two.

55
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,920
And we can solve this
just using the

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,150
exponential response formula.

57
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,220
So what we're going to do is
we're just going to complexify

58
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,470
the right-hand side.

59
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,150

60
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,170
So if I want to solve the
differential equation, x dot,

61
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,300
dot plus 2x dot plus 4x equals
sine nt, I'm going to denote

62
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,200
the solution with
the subscript n.

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,900
And it's going to be the
imaginary part of-- and I'm

64
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,430
just using the exponential
response formula--

65
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,490
1 over the characteristic
polynomial evaluated at in e

66
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,420
to the int.

67
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,700
You might ask how
do I get that.

68
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,670

69
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:15,960
Well, I basically just took the
complexified equation, and

70
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,440
noted that sine nt was the
imaginary part of e to the

71
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,200
int, and then use the
exponential response formula.

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,770
And I want to take the
imaginary part at

73
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,020
the end of the day.

74
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,760

75
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,630
So what is the characteristic
polynomial?

76
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,740
In this case, it's s squared
plus 2s plus 4, which means

77
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,220
that p of in is going to be
negative n squared plus 4--

78
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,820
So I'll just group the
real terms together--

79
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:54,570
plus 2 in, so the 2in comes from
the two s terms. And then

80
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:01,960
x of n is going to be the
imaginary part of 1 over 4

81
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,720
minus n squared plus
2in e to the int.

82
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,100

83
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:18,240
And I'm going to use the
amplitude phase form.

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,100

85
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,900
I'm going to convert this
Cartesian complex number into

86
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,090
an amplitude phase form just
because it's taking the

87
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,910
imaginary part of the solution
very easy at

88
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,160
the end of the day.

89
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,100

90
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,030
So the amplitude of this complex
number is 4 minus n

91
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,520
squared quantity squared plus
the imaginary part squared, so

92
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,900
that's 4n squared,
square rooted.

93
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,790

94
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:58,930
And then, upstairs is eint.

95
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,600
And downstairs, it's
going to be ei phi.

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,550
And I'm going to put a subscript
n on the phi just

97
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,770
because for each complex number,
we're going to have a

98
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,740
different phase phi.

99
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:23,610
And that phase phi end is going
to be the arctangent of

100
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:33,480
2n divided by 4 minus n
squared, like that.

101
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,430

102
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,000
So now, I can combine phi of n
with the upstairs term, int,

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,740
in the exponent.

104
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,180
And when I take the imaginary
part, I'm only going to be

105
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,200
left with sine of
nt minus phi n.

106
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:02,350
So x of n is going to be 1 over
4 minus n squared squared

107
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:10,790
plus 4n squared quantity
squared --

108
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,780
square rooted --

109
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:20,350
times sine of nt minus phi n,
where phi n was given using

110
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,050
the arctangent formula.

111
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,160
And this gives us a solution,
which note is

112
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,340
periodic with period 2t.

113
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,020
PROFESSOR: Right.

115
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:46,490
I should also note that phi
of n is between 0 and pi.

116
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,010

117
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,270
And this gives us the one
solution to the differential

118
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,860
equation with a forcing
of sine nt on

119
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,130
the right-hand side.

120
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,060
So now what we want to do is we
want sum up many of these

121
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,850
solutions using the
superposition principle.

122
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,330
So if I go back now, I'm going
to write the original

123
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,580
differential equation.

124
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,280

125
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,320
So I'm just going to go back
and just rewrite this.

126
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,500
And I'm going to write the
right-hand side using its

127
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:24,920
Fourier series, 1 over n sine
nt, where n is odd.

128
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,570

129
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,170
And this is the problem we
originally wanted to solve.

130
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,190
And essentially what we've
done is we've solved the

131
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,240
problem for each individual
sine nt.

132
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,880
So how do we get the
full solution?

133
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,289
Well, what we have to do is we
have to multiply the solution

134
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,970
for each sine nt by a factor
of 4 divided by

135
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,500
pi and 1 over n.

136
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,750
And then, we have to add all of
these solutions up for all

137
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,000
odd values of n.

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,360

139
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:02,190
So for example, x is just going
to be 4 over pi sum of n

140
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:10,620
odd, 1 over n times the solution
to every sine nt,

141
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,560
which we've already
computed, and I've

142
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,925
denoted it as x sub n.

143
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:17,870
And x sub n is up here.

144
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,360
So if we want to be explicit
about it, I'll write the whole

145
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:33,780
thing out as 4 over pi n odd,
1 over 4 minus n squared

146
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:39,720
quantity squared plus 4n
squared square rooted.

147
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,500
We also have a factor
of n out front.

148
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,174
We have a sine nt minus phi n.

149
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:51,890

150
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,630
So there's the final answer for
a particular solution in

151
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,320
its full glorious detail.

152
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,550
We can also check that this

153
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,330
particular solution is periodic.

154
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,740
Note how each sine
nt is periodic.

155
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,070
And each sine nt has period
of at least 2pi.

156
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,380
So when we sum up a whole bunch
of functions which all

157
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,260
have a period of at least 2pi,
the sum is also going to be

158
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,610
periodic function with
at least 2pi.

159
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,250

160
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,770
And as a result, this gives us
the answer we're looking for.

161
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,120
Also, in addition, if we want
the full general solution to

162
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,220
the differential equation to
this particular solution, we

163
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,340
also have to add the
homogeneous piece.

164
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,610
So this concludes the problem.

165
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,460
And I'll just quickly recap.

166
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,540
When solving a differential
equation with a periodic

167
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,910
forcing function on the
right-hand side, again, to

168
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,770
iterate the steps, you first,
Fourier decompose the

169
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,940
right-hand side into summation
of sines and cosines.

170
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,100
You then solve the differential
equation for sine

171
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,810
nt cosine nt individually.

172
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,270
This gives you a solution for
each term on the right-hand

173
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,250
side of the differential
equation.

174
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,110
And then at the end of the day,
you use superposition to

175
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,260
sum up all of the solutions.

176
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,910
