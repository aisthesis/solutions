00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,290

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,280
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,570
Welcome back.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,900
So today we're going to take a
look at solving differential

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,510
equations using the Laplace
transforms, and the problem

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,130
we're going to take a look at is
a simple ODE, x-dot plus 2x

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,880
equals 3 delta t plus
5 is a forcing on

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,770
the right hand side.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,330
We're going to look at having
rest initial conditions, x of

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,350
0 minus is equal to 0, and we're
asked to use Laplace

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,630
transforms to solve this
initial value problem.

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,060
For part B, we're asked to have
the initial value problem

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,800
without any delta function
forcing on the right-hand side

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,130
to give it an equivalent initial
value problem without

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,800
it delta function forcing on
the right-hand side, but

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,050
yields the same solution
as in part A.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,380
And then in question two,
we're asked to solve the

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,660
second order differential
equation, x-dot-dot plus 9x

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,330
equals u of t with rest initial
conditions, so x of 0

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,370
minus is 0, x-dot of
0 minus is also 0.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,230
So I'll let you work on
this problem, and I'll

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,480
be back in a moment.

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:18,548

24
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:19,620
Hi, everyone.

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,350
Welcome back.

26
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,260
OK, so for part A, the first
step is to Laplace transform

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,510
both sides of the equation.

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,640
So we take the Laplace transform
of x-dot plus 2x,

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
and that's going to be equal to
the Laplace transform of 3

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,850
delta of t equals 5.

31
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,900
And we can use the distribution
properties of the

32
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,510
Laplace transform, so this is
going to be Laplace transform

33
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:54,540
of x-dot plus 2 times the
Laplace transform of x.

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,130
On the right-hand side, we have
three times the Laplace

35
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:03,750
transform of the delta function
plus 5 times the

36
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,000
Laplace transform of 1.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,380

38
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,200
Now, we can replace the Laplace
transform of x-dot if

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,560
we use the identity with s times
the Laplace transform of

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,570
x minus x 0 minus.

41
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,850
And we're told that x of 0 minus
in this case is just 0,

42
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,130
so this term's going
to vanish.

43
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,240
And just for brevity, I'm going
to write x of s as the

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,190
Laplace transform of x.

45
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:46,910
So we now have s times x of s
plus 2x of s equals, and on

46
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,050
the right-hand side, we have
three times the Laplace

47
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,280
transform of the
delta function.

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,660
Laplace transform of the delta
function is just one, so we

49
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,510
have 3 plus 5, and the Laplace
transform of 1

50
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,760
is just 1 over s.

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,300

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,110
So I can now factor the
left-hand side, and I get x of

53
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:18,110
s times s plus 2 equals
3 plus 5 over s.

54
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,940
And note how, when we have
x of s multiplied by some

55
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,890
polynomial in s, this is
always going to be the

56
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,830
characteristic polynomial.

57
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,190
So if we look back, s plus
2 is the characteristic

58
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,925
polynomial of x-dot plus 2x.

59
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:35,560

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,700
So this yields 3 divided by s
plus 2, on the right-hand

61
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,740
side, plus 5 divided by
s times s plus 2.

62
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,690
And for the second piece, we can
use partial fractions to

63
00:03:52,690 --> 00:04:00,810
decompose it into a term times
s and a term times s plus 2.

64
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:11,350
And when we do that, we end up
getting 5/2 1 over s minus 1

65
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,600
over s plus 2.

66
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:19,029

67
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,920
So I can combine the 3 divided
by s plus 2 with the minus 5/2

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,550
divided by s plus
2 into one term.

69
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,610

70
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,810
So this gives you 1/2 1 over
s plus 2, and we also

71
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,630
have 5/2 1 over s.

72
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,830
And now we just take the inverse
Laplace transform of

73
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,940
both sides.

74
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:50,280
So on the left-hand side, we
recover x of t, so we get 1/2

75
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,200
e to the minus 2t plus 5/2.

76
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,230
The inverse Laplace transform
of 1/s is just 1.

77
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,270

78
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:09,190
So we end up with x of t is 1/2
e to minus 2t plus 5/2,

79
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,200
and this solution is valid
for t bigger than 0.

80
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,650
Sometimes, people write it as
this quantity multiplied by

81
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,940
step function.

82
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:25,180
And x of t is also 0 for t
less than 0, for example.

83
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,420

84
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,250
And it's just useful to quickly
sketch what x of t

85
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,280
looks like, so it's an
exponential decay for t bigger

86
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,930
than 0, and it's flat
for t less than 0.

87
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,053
So here's our x of t.

88
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,760

89
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,510
So for part B, now, we're asked
to find a differential

90
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,370
equation and new initial
conditions that reproduce the

91
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,970
solution offered t
bigger than 0.

92
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:05,080
So note how we'd be looking for
a new solution, x of t,

93
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,090
which would be an exponential
decay.

94
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,210
And essentially, we just grow,
so we're looking at initial

95
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,230
conditions, which start at 0.

96
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,320
If I were to write the original

97
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,380
differential equation--

98
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,660
So this is the original
differential equation from

99
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,500
part A. Looks like this.

100
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,060
And just quickly to note that
x-dot near the origin is going

101
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,610
to be approximately three times
the delta function,

102
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,140
which means in the original
differential equation, x is

103
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,880
going to have a jump of three
about the origin.

104
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,460
So the new initial
value problem--

105
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,850
Well, we don't want the delta
function on the right-hand

106
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:00,390
side, so we're going to solve
x-dot plus 2x is equal to 5.

107
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,520
But what initial conditions
do we need?

108
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:10,430
Well, we need x of 0
minus to now be 3.

109
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,250
So when we eliminate the 3 delta
on the right-hand side,

110
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,270
we have to introduce new initial
conditions so that the

111
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,380
solution agrees for
t bigger than 0.

112
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,910

113
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,020
OK, so this concludes
part one.

114
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,520
For part two, we're asked to
solve a new differential

115
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:43,210
equation, x-dot-dot plus 9x
equals u of t, and we're just

116
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,990
going to follow the same
procedure where we Laplace

117
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,130
transform both sides.

118
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,260
So Laplace transforming the
left-hand side gives me

119
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,160
x-dot-dot plus 9x equals the
Laplace transform of u of t.

120
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,130

121
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,680
And again, I can use the
formula, which relates

122
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:12,320
derivatives of x back to the
Laplace transform of x, and so

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,020
in this case, the Laplace
transform of x-dot-dot is

124
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,130
going to be s squared times the
Laplace transform of x.

125
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,130
And then I'm going to have plus
a term which involves x

126
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,000
of 0 minus and a term which
involves x-dot of 0 minus.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,790
And if your initial conditions
were not 0, you would have to

128
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,070
keep these terms in.

129
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,020
However in our case, these terms
are both 0 because we

130
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,470
deal with rest initial
conditions, I'm just not going

131
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,400
to write them.

132
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,220
Plus 9x of s equals the Laplace

133
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,980
transform of u oft is 1/s.

134
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,730

135
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,600
So again, we have x
of s s2 plus 9--

136
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,920
so note again how this is the
same characteristic polynomial

137
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,670
as in our differential
equation--

138
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,920
Is equal to 1/s.

139
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,990

140
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:13,780
So x of s is 1/s s squared
plus 9, which we can use

141
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,680
partial fractions, now, to
decompose it into a/s plus bs

142
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,980
plus c divided by s
squared plus 9.

143
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,840
And if I were to take a look at
my notes, I have, in this

144
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:41,313
case, a is 1/9th, b is -1/9th,
and c is equal to 0, if you

145
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:44,470
were to work out these
coefficients.

146
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:58,960
So what this means is x of
s is 1/s minus 1/9th 1/s

147
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,400
squared plus 9.

148
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,090

149
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:15,370
And when we invert the Laplace
transform, the inverse of 1/s

150
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,790
it's just 1, so x of
t becomes 1/9.

151
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,645

152
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:25,390
Sorry, this should
be s up here.

153
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,010
The inverse Laplace transform of
s divided by s squared plus

154
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:37,370
9 is cosine 3, so we end up with
-1/9th cosine of 3t, and

155
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,770
again, this is a solution
for t bigger than 0.

156
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,610
So as soon as we turn on the
input, the function x of t

157
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,660
starts growing continuously from
1, and then achieves an

158
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,910
oscillation with period 3.

159
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,760

160
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,330
So just to quickly recap, in
this problem, we solved

161
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,440
several ODEs, several initial
value problem ODEs using

162
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,140
Laplace transforms. Laplace
transforms are particularly

163
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,230
nice because they convert
an ODE into an algebraic

164
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,970
equation, which we can
solve fairly easily.

165
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,620
The drawback is we sometimes
have to manipulate, using

166
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,490
partial fractions, the
right-hand side into functions

167
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,740
that we know how to
invert using the

168
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,940
Laplace transform inverse.

169
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,150
So I'll just conclude here, and
I'll see you next time.

170
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,138
