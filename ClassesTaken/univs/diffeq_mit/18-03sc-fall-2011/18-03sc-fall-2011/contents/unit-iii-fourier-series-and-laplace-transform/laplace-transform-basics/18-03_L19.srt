1
00:00:08 --> 00:00:14
Today, and for the next two
weeks, we are going to be

2
00:00:11 --> 00:00:17
studying what,
for many engineers and a few

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
scientists is the most popular
method of solving any

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:24
differential equation of the
kind that they happen to be,

5
00:00:22 --> 00:00:28
and that is to use the popular
machine called the Laplace

6
00:00:26 --> 00:00:32
transform.
Now, you will get proficient in

7
00:00:30 --> 00:00:36
using it by the end of the two
weeks.

8
00:00:32 --> 00:00:38
But, there is always a certain
amount of mystery that hangs

9
00:00:36 --> 00:00:42
around it.
People scratch their heads and

10
00:00:38 --> 00:00:44
can't figure out where it comes
from.

11
00:00:41 --> 00:00:47
And, that bothers them a lot.
In the past,

12
00:00:43 --> 00:00:49
I've usually promised to tell
you, the students at the end of

13
00:00:47 --> 00:00:53
the two weeks,
but I almost never have time.

14
00:00:50 --> 00:00:56
So, I'm going to break that
glorious tradition and tell you

15
00:00:54 --> 00:01:00
up front at the beginning,
where it comes from,

16
00:00:57 --> 00:01:03
and then talk very fast for the
rest of the period.

17
00:01:02 --> 00:01:08
Okay, a good way of thinking of
where the Laplace transform

18
00:01:06 --> 00:01:12
comes from, and a way which I
think dispels some of its

19
00:01:10 --> 00:01:16
mystery is by thinking of power
series.

20
00:01:13 --> 00:01:19
I think virtually all of you
have studied power series except

21
00:01:17 --> 00:01:23
possibly a few students who just
had 18.01 here last semester,

22
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
and probably shouldn't be
taking 18.03 anyway,

23
00:01:25 --> 00:01:31
now.
But anyway, a power series

24
00:01:28 --> 00:01:34
looks like this:
summation (a)n x to the n.

25
00:01:31 --> 00:01:37
And, you sum that from,

26
00:01:35 --> 00:01:41
let's say, zero to infinity.
And, the typical thing you want

27
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
to do with it is add it up to
find out what its sum is.

28
00:01:44 --> 00:01:50
Now, the only way I will depart
from tradition,

29
00:01:48 --> 00:01:54
instead of calling the sum some
generic name like f of x,

30
00:01:52 --> 00:01:58
in order to identify
the sum with the coefficients,

31
00:01:57 --> 00:02:03
a, I'll call it a of x.

32
00:01:59 --> 00:02:05
Now, I want to make just one
slight change in that.

33
00:02:05 --> 00:02:11
I want to use computer
notation, which doesn't use the

34
00:02:08 --> 00:02:14
subscript (a)n.
Instead, this,

35
00:02:11 --> 00:02:17
it thinks of as a function of
the discreet variable,

36
00:02:14 --> 00:02:20
n.
In other words,

37
00:02:15 --> 00:02:21
it's a function which assigns
to n equals zero,

38
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
one, two, three real numbers.
That's what this sequence of

39
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
coefficients really is.
So, the computer notation will

40
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
look almost the same.
It's just that I will write

41
00:02:32 --> 00:02:38
this in functional notation as a
of n instead of (a)n.

42
00:02:37 --> 00:02:43
But, it still means the real
number associated with the

43
00:02:41 --> 00:02:47
positive integer,
n, and everything else is the

44
00:02:45 --> 00:02:51
same.
See, what I'm thinking of this

45
00:02:48 --> 00:02:54
as doing is taking this discreet
function, which gives me the

46
00:02:53 --> 00:02:59
sequence of coefficients of the
power series,

47
00:02:56 --> 00:03:02
and associating that with the
sum of the power series.

48
00:03:02 --> 00:03:08
Let me give you some very
simple examples,

49
00:03:05 --> 00:03:11
two very simple examples,
which I think you know.

50
00:03:08 --> 00:03:14
Suppose this is a function one.
Now, what do I mean by that?

51
00:03:13 --> 00:03:19
I mean it's the constant
function, one.

52
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
To every positive integer,
it assigns the number one.

53
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
Okay, what's a of x?
What I'm saying is,

54
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
in other words,
in this fancy,

55
00:03:25 --> 00:03:31
mystifying form,
is all of these guys are one,

56
00:03:28 --> 00:03:34
what's a of x?
One plus x plus x squared plus

57
00:03:33 --> 00:03:39
x cubed.
Look, you are supposed to be

58
00:03:37 --> 00:03:43
born knowing what that adds up
to.

59
00:03:39 --> 00:03:45
It adds up to one over one
minus x,

60
00:03:43 --> 00:03:49
except that's the wrong answer.
What's wrong about it?

61
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
It's not true for every value
of x.

62
00:03:49 --> 00:03:55
That's only true when x is such
that that series converges,

63
00:03:54 --> 00:04:00
and that is only true when x
lies between negative one and

64
00:03:58 --> 00:04:04
one.
So, it's not this function.

65
00:04:03 --> 00:04:09
It's this function with its
domain restricted to be less

66
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
than one in absolute value.
What does that converge to?

67
00:04:11 --> 00:04:17
If x is bigger than one,
the answer is it doesn't

68
00:04:16 --> 00:04:22
converge.
There's nothing else you can

69
00:04:19 --> 00:04:25
put here.
Okay, let's take another

70
00:04:21 --> 00:04:27
function.
Suppose this is,

71
00:04:23 --> 00:04:29
let's see, one over n
you probably won't know.

72
00:04:29 --> 00:04:35
Let's take one you will know,
one over n factorial.

73
00:04:33 --> 00:04:39
Suppose a of n is the function

74
00:04:35 --> 00:04:41
one over n factorial,

75
00:04:38 --> 00:04:44
what's a of x?
So, what I'm asking is,

76
00:04:41 --> 00:04:47
what does this add up to when
the coefficient here is one over

77
00:04:46 --> 00:04:52
n factorial?

78
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
What's summation x to the n
over n factorial?

79
00:04:51 --> 00:04:57
It is e to the x.

80
00:04:54 --> 00:05:00
And, this doesn't have to be
qualified because this is true

81
00:04:58 --> 00:05:04
for all values of x.
So, in other words,

82
00:05:02 --> 00:05:08
from this peculiar point of
view, I think of a power as

83
00:05:05 --> 00:05:11
summing the operation,
of summing a power series as

84
00:05:09 --> 00:05:15
taking a discreet function
defined for positive integers,

85
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
or nonnegative integers,
and doing this funny process.

86
00:05:16 --> 00:05:22
And, out of it comes a
continuous function of some

87
00:05:20 --> 00:05:26
sort.
And, notice what goes in is the

88
00:05:22 --> 00:05:28
variable, n.
But, what comes out is the

89
00:05:25 --> 00:05:31
variable, x.
Well, that's perfectly natural.

90
00:05:29 --> 00:05:35
That's the way a power series
is set up.

91
00:05:32 --> 00:05:38
So, the question I ask is,
this is a discreet situation,

92
00:05:38 --> 00:05:44
a discreet summation.
Suppose I made the summation

93
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
continuous instead of discreet.
So, I want the continuous

94
00:05:48 --> 00:05:54
analog of what I did over there.
Okay, what would a continuous

95
00:05:54 --> 00:06:00
analog be?
Well, instead of,

96
00:05:57 --> 00:06:03
I'll replace n zero,
one, two, that will be replaced

97
00:06:02 --> 00:06:08
by a continued,
that's a discreet variable.

98
00:06:08 --> 00:06:14
I'll replace it by a continuous
variable, t, which runs from

99
00:06:13 --> 00:06:19
zero to infinity,
and is allowed to take every

100
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
real value in between instead of
being only allowed to take the

101
00:06:22 --> 00:06:28
values of the positive
nonnegative integers.

102
00:06:27 --> 00:06:33
Okay, well, if I want to use t
instead of n,

103
00:06:30 --> 00:06:36
I clearly cannot sum in the
usual way over all real numbers.

104
00:06:34 --> 00:06:40
But, the way the procedure
which replaces summation over

105
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
all real numbers is integration.
So, what I'm going to do is

106
00:06:42 --> 00:06:48
replace that sum by the integral
from zero to infinity.

107
00:06:46 --> 00:06:52
That's like the sum from zero
to infinity of what?

108
00:06:50 --> 00:06:56
Well, of some function,
but now n is being replaced by

109
00:06:54 --> 00:07:00
the continuous variable,
t.

110
00:06:55 --> 00:07:01
So, this is going to be a
function of t.

111
00:07:00 --> 00:07:06
And, how about the rest of it?
The rest I will just copy,

112
00:07:04 --> 00:07:10
x to the n'th.
Well, instead of n I have to

113
00:07:07 --> 00:07:13
write t and dt.
And, what's the sum?

114
00:07:09 --> 00:07:15
Well, I'll call the sum,
what's the sum a function of?

115
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
I integrate out the t.
So, that doesn't appear in the

116
00:07:17 --> 00:07:23
answer.
All that appears is this

117
00:07:19 --> 00:07:25
number, x, this parameter,
x.

118
00:07:21 --> 00:07:27
For each value of x,
like one, two,

119
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
or 26.3, this integral has a
certain value,

120
00:07:26 --> 00:07:32
and I can calculate it.
So, this is going to end up as

121
00:07:30 --> 00:07:36
a function of x,
just as it did before.

122
00:07:35 --> 00:07:41
Now, I could leave it in that
form, but no mathematician would

123
00:07:39 --> 00:07:45
like to do that,
and very few engineers either.

124
00:07:42 --> 00:07:48
The reason is,
in general, when you do

125
00:07:45 --> 00:07:51
integration and differentiation,
you do not want to have as the

126
00:07:50 --> 00:07:56
base of an exponential something
like x.

127
00:07:53 --> 00:07:59
The only convenient thing to
have is e, and the reason is

128
00:07:57 --> 00:08:03
because it's only e that people
really like to differentiate,

129
00:08:01 --> 00:08:07
e to the something.
The only thing is that people

130
00:08:05 --> 00:08:11
really like to differentiate or
integrate.

131
00:08:08 --> 00:08:14
So, I'm going to make this look
a little better by converting x

132
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
to the t to the base e.
I remember how to do that.

133
00:08:17 --> 00:08:23
You write x equals e to the log
x and so x to

134
00:08:21 --> 00:08:27
the t will be e to the
log x times t,

135
00:08:25 --> 00:08:31
if you want.
Now, the only problem is I want

136
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
to make one more little change.
After all, I want to be able to

137
00:08:32 --> 00:08:38
calculate this integral.
And, it's clear that if t is

138
00:08:36 --> 00:08:42
going to infinity,
if I have a number here,

139
00:08:39 --> 00:08:45
for example,
like x equals two,

140
00:08:40 --> 00:08:46
that integral is really quite
unlikely to converge.

141
00:08:44 --> 00:08:50
For example,
if a of t were just

142
00:08:46 --> 00:08:52
the constant function,
one, the integral certainly

143
00:08:49 --> 00:08:55
wouldn't converge.
It would be horrible.

144
00:08:52 --> 00:08:58
That integral only has a chance
of converging if x is a number

145
00:08:56 --> 00:09:02
less than one,
so that when I take bigger and

146
00:08:59 --> 00:09:05
bigger powers of it,
I get smaller and smaller

147
00:09:02 --> 00:09:08
numbers.
Don't forget,

148
00:09:04 --> 00:09:10
this is an improper integral
going all the way up to

149
00:09:08 --> 00:09:14
infinity.
Those need treatment,

150
00:09:10 --> 00:09:16
delicate handling.
All right, so I really want x

151
00:09:13 --> 00:09:19
to be less than one.
Otherwise, that integral is

152
00:09:16 --> 00:09:22
very unlikely to converge.
I'd better have it positive,

153
00:09:20 --> 00:09:26
because if I allow it to be
negative I'm going to get into

154
00:09:23 --> 00:09:29
trouble with negative powers,
see what's minus one,

155
00:09:26 --> 00:09:32
for example,
to the one half when t is one

156
00:09:29 --> 00:09:35
half.
That's already imaginary.

157
00:09:32 --> 00:09:38
I don't want that.
If you've got an exponential,

158
00:09:35 --> 00:09:41
the base has got to be a
positive number.

159
00:09:38 --> 00:09:44
So, I want x to be a positive
number.

160
00:09:41 --> 00:09:47
All right, if x in my actual
practices going to lie between

161
00:09:44 --> 00:09:50
zero and one in order to make
the integral converge,

162
00:09:48 --> 00:09:54
how about log x?
Well, log x,

163
00:09:50 --> 00:09:56
if x is less than one,
so log x is going to be

164
00:09:53 --> 00:09:59
less than zero,
and it's going to go all the

165
00:09:57 --> 00:10:03
way down to negative infinity.
So, this means log x is

166
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
negative.
In this interesting range of x,

167
00:10:05 --> 00:10:11
the log x is always going to be
negative.

168
00:10:08 --> 00:10:14
And now, I don't like that.
The first place I'd like to

169
00:10:11 --> 00:10:17
call this by a new variable
since no one uses log x as a

170
00:10:15 --> 00:10:21
variable.
And, it would make sense to

171
00:10:18 --> 00:10:24
make it a negative,
to make it negative,

172
00:10:20 --> 00:10:26
that is, to write log x is
equal to negative s.

173
00:10:24 --> 00:10:30
Let's put it on the other side,
in order that since log x is

174
00:10:28 --> 00:10:34
always going to be less than
zero, then s will always be

175
00:10:32 --> 00:10:38
positive.
And it's always more convenient

176
00:10:35 --> 00:10:41
to work with positive numbers
instead of negative numbers.

177
00:10:39 --> 00:10:45
So, if I make those changes,
what happens to the integral?

178
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
Well, I stress,
all these changes are just

179
00:10:44 --> 00:10:50
cosmetic to make things a little
easier to work with in terms of

180
00:10:48 --> 00:10:54
symbols.
First of all,

181
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
the a I'm going to change.
I don't want to call it a of t

182
00:10:52 --> 00:10:58
because most people
don't call functions a of t.

183
00:10:55 --> 00:11:01
They call them f of t.
So, I'll call it f of t.

184
00:10:58 --> 00:11:04
x is e to the log x,
which is e to the minus s.

185
00:11:01 --> 00:11:07
So, x has its name changed to e

186
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
to the minus s.
In other words,

187
00:11:09 --> 00:11:15
I'm using as the new variable
not x any longer but s in order

188
00:11:13 --> 00:11:19
that the base be e.
t, I now raise this to the t'th

189
00:11:17 --> 00:11:23
power, but by the laws of
exponents, that means I simply

190
00:11:21 --> 00:11:27
multiply the exponent by t,
and dt.

191
00:11:24 --> 00:11:30
And now, since I'm calling the
function f of t,

192
00:11:28 --> 00:11:34
the output ought to be called
capital F.

193
00:11:32 --> 00:11:38
But it's now a function,
since I've changed the

194
00:11:35 --> 00:11:41
variable, of s.
It's no longer a function of x.

195
00:11:39 --> 00:11:45
If you like,
you may think of this as a of,

196
00:11:42 --> 00:11:48
what's x?
x is e to the negative s,

197
00:11:46 --> 00:11:52
I guess.
I mean, no one would leave a

198
00:11:49 --> 00:11:55
function in that form.
It's simply a function of s.

199
00:11:53 --> 00:11:59
And, what is that?
So, what have we got,

200
00:11:57 --> 00:12:03
finally?
What we have,

201
00:11:58 --> 00:12:04
dear hearts,
is this thing,

202
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
which I stress is nothing more
than the continuous analog of

203
00:12:05 --> 00:12:11
the summation of a power series.
This is the discrete version.

204
00:12:12 --> 00:12:18
This is by these perfectly
natural transformations the

205
00:12:16 --> 00:12:22
continuous version of the same
thing.

206
00:12:19 --> 00:12:25
It starts with a function
defined for positive values of

207
00:12:23 --> 00:12:29
t, and turns it into a function
of s.

208
00:12:26 --> 00:12:32
And, this is called the Laplace
transform.

209
00:12:29 --> 00:12:35
Now, if I've done my work
correctly, you should all be

210
00:12:34 --> 00:12:40
saying, oh, is that all?
But, I know you aren't.

211
00:12:37 --> 00:12:43
So, it's okay.
You'll get used to it.

212
00:12:42 --> 00:12:48
The first thing you have to get
used to is one thing some people

213
00:12:46 --> 00:12:52
never get used to,
which is you put in a function

214
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
of t, and you get out a function
of s.

215
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
How could that be?
You know, for an operator,

216
00:12:56 --> 00:13:02
you put in 3x,
and you get out three if it's a

217
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
differentiation operator.
In other words,

218
00:13:04 --> 00:13:10
when you have an operator,
the things we've been talking

219
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
about the last two or three
weeks in one form or another,

220
00:13:13 --> 00:13:19
at least the variable doesn't
get changed.

221
00:13:16 --> 00:13:22
Well, but for a transform it
does, and that's why it's called

222
00:13:21 --> 00:13:27
a transform.
So, the difference between a

223
00:13:24 --> 00:13:30
transform and an operator is
that for a transform a function

224
00:13:29 --> 00:13:35
of t comes in,
but a function of s comes out.

225
00:13:34 --> 00:13:40
The variable gets changed,
whereas for an operator,

226
00:13:37 --> 00:13:43
f of t goes in and
what comes out is g of t,

227
00:13:40 --> 00:13:46
a function using the
same variable like

228
00:13:43 --> 00:13:49
differentiation is a typical
example of an operator,

229
00:13:47 --> 00:13:53
or the linear differential
operators we've been talking

230
00:13:50 --> 00:13:56
about.
Well, but this doesn't behave

231
00:13:52 --> 00:13:58
that way.
The variable does get changed.

232
00:13:55 --> 00:14:01
That's, in fact,
extremely important in the

233
00:13:58 --> 00:14:04
applications.
In the applications,

234
00:14:01 --> 00:14:07
t usually means the time,
and s very often,

235
00:14:05 --> 00:14:11
not always, but very often is a
variable measuring frequency,

236
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
for instance.
But, so that's a peculiar thing

237
00:14:14 --> 00:14:20
that's hard to get used to.
But, a good thing is the fact

238
00:14:18 --> 00:14:24
that it's a linear transform.
In other words,

239
00:14:22 --> 00:14:28
it obeys the laws we'd love and
like that the Laplace

240
00:14:26 --> 00:14:32
transform-- oh,
I never gave you any notation

241
00:14:30 --> 00:14:36
for the laplace transform.
Hey, I'd better do that.

242
00:14:35 --> 00:14:41
Okay, so, some notation:
there are two notations that

243
00:14:39 --> 00:14:45
are used.
Your book mostly uses the

244
00:14:41 --> 00:14:47
notation that the laplace
transform of f of t is capital F

245
00:14:45 --> 00:14:51
of s,
uses the same letter but with

246
00:14:48 --> 00:14:54
the same capital.
Now, as you will see,

247
00:14:51 --> 00:14:57
there are some places you
absolutely cannot use that

248
00:14:54 --> 00:15:00
notation.
It may seem strange,

249
00:14:56 --> 00:15:02
looks perfectly natural.
There are certain laws you

250
00:14:59 --> 00:15:05
cannot express using that
notation.

251
00:15:03 --> 00:15:09
It's baffling.
But, if you can't do it this

252
00:15:05 --> 00:15:11
way, you can do it using this
notation instead.

253
00:15:08 --> 00:15:14
One or the other will almost
always work.

254
00:15:11 --> 00:15:17
So, I'll use my little squiggly
notation, but that's what I use.

255
00:15:15 --> 00:15:21
I think it's a little more
vivid, and the trouble is that

256
00:15:19 --> 00:15:25
this piles up too many
parentheses.

257
00:15:21 --> 00:15:27
And, that's always hard to
read.

258
00:15:23 --> 00:15:29
So, I like this better.
So, these are two alternate

259
00:15:26 --> 00:15:32
ways of saying the same thing.
The Laplace transform of this

260
00:15:32 --> 00:15:38
function is that one.
Okay, well, let's use,

261
00:15:36 --> 00:15:42
for the linearity law,
it's definitely best.

262
00:15:39 --> 00:15:45
I really cannot express the
linearity law using the second

263
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
notation, but using the first
notation, it's a breeze.

264
00:15:49 --> 00:15:55
The Laplace transform of the
sum of two functions is the sum

265
00:15:54 --> 00:16:00
of their Laplace transforms of
each of them separately.

266
00:16:00 --> 00:16:06
Or, better yet,
you could write it that way.

267
00:16:03 --> 00:16:09
Let's write it this way.
That way, it looks more like an

268
00:16:06 --> 00:16:12
operator, L of f plus L of g.

269
00:16:10 --> 00:16:16
And, of the same way,
if you take a function and

270
00:16:13 --> 00:16:19
multiply it by a constant and
take the laplace transform,

271
00:16:17 --> 00:16:23
you can pull the constant
outside.

272
00:16:19 --> 00:16:25
And, of course,
why are these true?

273
00:16:22 --> 00:16:28
These are true just because of
the form of the transform.

274
00:16:25 --> 00:16:31
If I add up f and g,
I simply add up the two

275
00:16:29 --> 00:16:35
corresponding integrals.
In other words,

276
00:16:33 --> 00:16:39
I'm using the fact that the
integral, this definite

277
00:16:37 --> 00:16:43
integral, is itself a linear
operator.

278
00:16:40 --> 00:16:46
Well, that's the general
setting.

279
00:16:43 --> 00:16:49
That's where it comes from,
and that's the notation for it.

280
00:16:47 --> 00:16:53
And, now we have to get to
work.

281
00:16:50 --> 00:16:56
The first thing to do to get
familiar with this is,

282
00:16:54 --> 00:17:00
obviously what we want to do is
say, okay, these were the

283
00:16:59 --> 00:17:05
transforms of some simple
discreet functions.

284
00:17:04 --> 00:17:10
Okay, suppose I put in some
familiar functions,

285
00:17:09 --> 00:17:15
f of t.
What do their Laplace

286
00:17:14 --> 00:17:20
transforms look like?
So, let's do that.

287
00:17:19 --> 00:17:25
So, one of the boards I should
keep stored.

288
00:17:24 --> 00:17:30
Why don't I store on this
board?

289
00:17:28 --> 00:17:34
I'll store on this board the
formulas as we get them.

290
00:17:37 --> 00:17:43
So, let's see,
what should we aim at,

291
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
first?
Let's first find,

292
00:17:41 --> 00:17:47
and I'll do the calculations on
the sideboard,

293
00:17:44 --> 00:17:50
and we'll see how it works out.
I'm not very sure.

294
00:17:47 --> 00:17:53
In other words,
what's the Laplace transform of

295
00:17:51 --> 00:17:57
the function,
one?

296
00:17:52 --> 00:17:58
Well, there's an even easier
one.

297
00:17:54 --> 00:18:00
What's the Laplace transform of
the function zero?

298
00:17:57 --> 00:18:03
Answer: zero.
Very exciting.

299
00:18:00 --> 00:18:06
What's the Laplace transform of
one?

300
00:18:03 --> 00:18:09
Well, it doesn't turn out the
constant anymore than it turned

301
00:18:07 --> 00:18:13
out to be a constant up there.
Let's calculate it.

302
00:18:11 --> 00:18:17
Now, you can do these
calculations carefully,

303
00:18:14 --> 00:18:20
dotting all the i's,
or pretty carefully,

304
00:18:17 --> 00:18:23
or not carefully at all,
i.e.

305
00:18:19 --> 00:18:25
sloppily.
I'll let you be sloppy after,

306
00:18:21 --> 00:18:27
generally speaking,
you could be sloppy unless the

307
00:18:25 --> 00:18:31
directions tell you to be less
sloppy or to be careful,

308
00:18:29 --> 00:18:35
okay?
So, I'll do one carefully.

309
00:18:32 --> 00:18:38
Let's calculate the Laplace
transform of one carefully.

310
00:18:36 --> 00:18:42
Okay, in the beginning,
you've got nothing to use with

311
00:18:40 --> 00:18:46
the definition.
So, I have to calculate the

312
00:18:43 --> 00:18:49
integral from zero to infinity
of one, that's the f of t times

313
00:18:47 --> 00:18:53
e to the negative s t,
so I don't have to

314
00:18:51 --> 00:18:57
put in the one,
dt.

315
00:18:52 --> 00:18:58
All right, now,
let me remind you,

316
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
this is an improper integral.
This is just about the first

317
00:18:58 --> 00:19:04
time in the course we've had an
improper integral.

318
00:19:01 --> 00:19:07
But, there are going to be a
lot of them over the next couple

319
00:19:06 --> 00:19:12
of weeks, nothing but.
All right, it's an improper

320
00:19:10 --> 00:19:16
integral.
That means we have to go back

321
00:19:12 --> 00:19:18
to the definition.
If you want to be careful,

322
00:19:15 --> 00:19:21
you have to go back to the
definition of improper integral.

323
00:19:19 --> 00:19:25
So, it's the limit,
as R goes to infinity,

324
00:19:21 --> 00:19:27
of what you get by integrating
only up as far as R.

325
00:19:24 --> 00:19:30
That's a definite integral.
That's a nice Riemann integral.

326
00:19:27 --> 00:19:33
So, this is what I have to
calculate.

327
00:19:31 --> 00:19:37
And, I have to take the limit
as R goes to infinity.

328
00:19:34 --> 00:19:40
Now, how do I calculate that?
Well, this integral is equal

329
00:19:37 --> 00:19:43
to, that's easy.
It's just integrating.

330
00:19:40 --> 00:19:46
Remember that you're
integrating with respect to t.

331
00:19:43 --> 00:19:49
So, s is a parameter.
It's like a constant,

332
00:19:45 --> 00:19:51
in other words.
So, it's e to the minus s t,

333
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
and when I differentiated,

334
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
the derivative of this would
have negative s.

335
00:19:53 --> 00:19:59
So, to get rid of that negative
s, so the derivative is e to the

336
00:19:57 --> 00:20:03
minus s t.
You have to put minus s

337
00:20:00 --> 00:20:06
in the denominator.
And now, I'll want to evaluate

338
00:20:05 --> 00:20:11
that between zero and R.
And, what do I get?

339
00:20:09 --> 00:20:15
Well it is at the upper limit.
So, it's e to the minus s times

340
00:20:14 --> 00:20:20
R minus, at the lower limit,
it's t is equal to zero,

341
00:20:19 --> 00:20:25
so whatever s is,
it's one.

342
00:20:21 --> 00:20:27
And that's divided by this
constant up front,

343
00:20:25 --> 00:20:31
negative s. So,

344
00:20:28 --> 00:20:34
the answer is,
it is equal to the limit of,

345
00:20:32 --> 00:20:38
as R goes to infinity,
of e to the negative s R minus

346
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
one divided by minus s.

347
00:20:43 --> 00:20:49
Now, what's that?
Well, as R goes to infinity,

348
00:20:47 --> 00:20:53
e to the minus 2R,
or minus 5R goes to zero,

349
00:20:52 --> 00:20:58
and the answer is minus one
over minus s.

350
00:20:57 --> 00:21:03
So, that's one over s.
And so, that's our answer.

351
00:21:02 --> 00:21:08
Let's put it up here.
It's one over s,

352
00:21:05 --> 00:21:11
except it isn't.
I made a mistake.

353
00:21:10 --> 00:21:16
Well, not mistake,
a little oversight.

354
00:21:16 --> 00:21:22
What's the oversight?
This is okay.

355
00:21:22 --> 00:21:28
This is okay.
This is okay.

356
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
This is not okay.
This is okay.

357
00:21:31 --> 00:21:37
But that's not okay.
What's wrong?

358
00:21:38 --> 00:21:44
I did slight a verbal hand.
Maybe some of you have picked

359
00:21:41 --> 00:21:47
it up and were too embarrassed
to correct me,

360
00:21:44 --> 00:21:50
but I said like e to the minus
2R obviously goes to

361
00:21:48 --> 00:21:54
zero, and e to the minus 5R
goes to zero.

362
00:21:51 --> 00:21:57
How about e to the minus minus
3 R?

363
00:21:54 --> 00:22:00
Does that go to zero?
No, that's e to the 3R,

364
00:21:57 --> 00:22:03
which goes to infinity.

365
00:22:00 --> 00:22:06
The only time this goes to zero
is if s is a positive number.

366
00:22:05 --> 00:22:11
Minus s looks like a negative
number, but it's not,

367
00:22:10 --> 00:22:16
if s is equal to minus two.
So, this is only true if s is

368
00:22:16 --> 00:22:22
positive because only if s is
positive is this exponent really

369
00:22:22 --> 00:22:28
negative and large,
and therefore going to

370
00:22:26 --> 00:22:32
infinity, going to zero as R
goes to infinity.

371
00:22:30 --> 00:22:36
So, the answer is not one over
s.

372
00:22:34 --> 00:22:40
It is one over s,
s must positive.

373
00:22:39 --> 00:22:45
Now, once again,
here, people don't worry about

374
00:22:41 --> 00:22:47
this sort of thing with power
series because it seems very

375
00:22:45 --> 00:22:51
obvious, you know,
one over x,

376
00:22:48 --> 00:22:54
absolute value of x is less
than one,

377
00:22:51 --> 00:22:57
when it gets to be the Laplace
transform, just because the

378
00:22:54 --> 00:23:00
Laplace transform is mysterious,
the question is,

379
00:22:58 --> 00:23:04
okay, the Laplace transform is
one over s of one,

380
00:23:01 --> 00:23:07
well, Laplace transform of one
I understand is one over s if s

381
00:23:05 --> 00:23:11
is positive.
What is it if s is negative?

382
00:23:09 --> 00:23:15
Okay, right down in your little
books, this, but that down,

383
00:23:15 --> 00:23:21
what is it if s is negative,
and write underneath that,

384
00:23:21 --> 00:23:27
this question is meaningless.
It doesn't mean anything.

385
00:23:26 --> 00:23:32
I'll draw you a picture.
This is a picture of the

386
00:23:31 --> 00:23:37
Laplace transform of one.
It is that.

387
00:23:34 --> 00:23:40
It's one branch of this curve.
It does not include the branch

388
00:23:39 --> 00:23:45
on the left.
It doesn't because I showed you

389
00:23:43 --> 00:23:49
it doesn't.
That's all there is to it.

390
00:23:46 --> 00:23:52
Okay, so I did that carefully.
Now I'm going to get a little

391
00:23:50 --> 00:23:56
less careful.
What's the Laplace transform of

392
00:23:54 --> 00:24:00
e to the a t?
First of all,

393
00:23:57 --> 00:24:03
in general, the kind of
functions for which people like

394
00:24:01 --> 00:24:07
to calculate the Laplace
transform, and basically the

395
00:24:06 --> 00:24:12
only ones there will be in the
tables are exactly the sort of

396
00:24:10 --> 00:24:16
functions that you used in
solving linear equations with

397
00:24:15 --> 00:24:21
constant coefficients.
What kinds of functions entered

398
00:24:21 --> 00:24:27
in there?
Exponentials,

399
00:24:22 --> 00:24:28
sines and cosines,
but they were really complex

400
00:24:25 --> 00:24:31
exponentials,
right?

401
00:24:26 --> 00:24:32
e to the t sine t,
but that was really a

402
00:24:30 --> 00:24:36
complex exponential,
too, just a little more

403
00:24:33 --> 00:24:39
complicated one,
polynomials,

404
00:24:35 --> 00:24:41
and that's about it.
t times e to the t,

405
00:24:38 --> 00:24:44
that was okay,
too.

406
00:24:41 --> 00:24:47
These are the functions for
which people calculate the

407
00:24:44 --> 00:24:50
Laplace transform,
and all the other functions

408
00:24:46 --> 00:24:52
they don't calculate the Laplace
transforms.

409
00:24:49 --> 00:24:55
So, I don't mean to disappoint
you here.

410
00:24:52 --> 00:24:58
You're going to say,
oh, what, that same old stuff?

411
00:24:55 --> 00:25:01
For two more weeks,
we've got that same,

412
00:24:57 --> 00:25:03
well, the Laplace transform
does a lot of things much better

413
00:25:01 --> 00:25:07
than the methods we've been
using.

414
00:25:04 --> 00:25:10
And, I won't.
I'll sell it when I get a

415
00:25:06 --> 00:25:12
chance to, for now,
let's just get familiar with

416
00:25:09 --> 00:25:15
it.
All right, so while I'm not

417
00:25:11 --> 00:25:17
going to calculate e to the a t
for you,

418
00:25:14 --> 00:25:20
because I'd like instead to
just prove a simple formula

419
00:25:17 --> 00:25:23
which will just give that,
and will also give us e to the

420
00:25:21 --> 00:25:27
a t sine t.
It will give us a lot more,

421
00:25:24 --> 00:25:30
instead.
I'm going to calculate a

422
00:25:27 --> 00:25:33
formula for the Laplace
transform of this guy if you

423
00:25:30 --> 00:25:36
already know the Laplace
transform of it.

424
00:25:34 --> 00:25:40
Now, see, this falls in that
category because this is really

425
00:25:38 --> 00:25:44
e to the a t times one.

426
00:25:41 --> 00:25:47
But, I already know the Laplace
transform of one.

427
00:25:44 --> 00:25:50
So that's, if I can get a
general formula for this,

428
00:25:48 --> 00:25:54
I'll be able to get the formula
for e to the a t as a

429
00:25:53 --> 00:25:59
consequence.
So, let's look for this Laplace

430
00:25:56 --> 00:26:02
transform.
Now, it's really easy.

431
00:25:59 --> 00:26:05
Let's see, where am I doing
calculations?

432
00:26:02 --> 00:26:08
Over here.
Okay, so we've got e.

433
00:26:05 --> 00:26:11
So, I want to calculate the
Laplace transform e to the a t f

434
00:26:09 --> 00:26:15
of t.
So I'm going to say that's the

435
00:26:13 --> 00:26:19
integral from zero to infinity
of e to the a t times f of t.

436
00:26:16 --> 00:26:22
And now, the rest I copy.

437
00:26:19 --> 00:26:25
That's the function part of it
that goes to the input,

438
00:26:23 --> 00:26:29
and then there's the other
part.

439
00:26:25 --> 00:26:31
This part is called the kernel,
by the way, but don't worry

440
00:26:29 --> 00:26:35
about that.
However, if you drop it in

441
00:26:33 --> 00:26:39
conversation,
people will look at you and

442
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
say, gee, they know something I
don't.

443
00:26:39 --> 00:26:45
And you will.
You know that it's the kernel.

444
00:26:43 --> 00:26:49
Okay, well, now,
what kind of formula can I be

445
00:26:47 --> 00:26:53
looking for?
Clearly, I can only be looking

446
00:26:51 --> 00:26:57
for a formula which expresses it
in terms of the Laplace

447
00:26:56 --> 00:27:02
transform of f of t.
Let's calculate and see what we

448
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
get.
Now, what would you do to that

449
00:27:04 --> 00:27:10
thing to make?
Well, obviously,

450
00:27:06 --> 00:27:12
the thing to do is to combine
the two exponentials.

451
00:27:09 --> 00:27:15
So, that's going to be the
integral from zero to infinity

452
00:27:13 --> 00:27:19
of f of t.
e, now, I'd like to put it,

453
00:27:16 --> 00:27:22
to combine the exponentials in
such a way that it has,

454
00:27:19 --> 00:27:25
still, that same form,
so, I'm going to begin with

455
00:27:23 --> 00:27:29
that negative sign,
and then see what the rest of

456
00:27:26 --> 00:27:32
it has to be.
What is it going to be?

457
00:27:30 --> 00:27:36
Well, minus s t and
plus a t,

458
00:27:34 --> 00:27:40
but I can make that minus a
here, and it will come out

459
00:27:39 --> 00:27:45
right.
So, it's minus s t plus a t,

460
00:27:42 --> 00:27:48
and there are the two parts,

461
00:27:46 --> 00:27:52
those two factors,
dt.

462
00:27:48 --> 00:27:54
So, what's that?
That's the Laplace transform.

463
00:27:52 --> 00:27:58
If the a weren't there,
this would be the Laplace

464
00:27:56 --> 00:28:02
transform of f of t.
What is it with the a there?

465
00:28:03 --> 00:28:09
It's the Laplace transform of f
of t,

466
00:28:08 --> 00:28:14
except that instead of the
variable, s has been replaced by

467
00:28:15 --> 00:28:21
the variable s minus a.

468
00:28:19 --> 00:28:25
I'll give you a second to
digest that.

469
00:28:24 --> 00:28:30
Well, you digest it while I'm
writing it because that's the

470
00:28:30 --> 00:28:36
answer.
And, the way this is most often

471
00:28:35 --> 00:28:41
used, I have to qualify it for
the value.

472
00:28:38 --> 00:28:44
So, if F of s is good
for s positive,

473
00:28:42 --> 00:28:48
the way it would be,
for example,

474
00:28:45 --> 00:28:51
if I used the function one
here, then to finish that off,

475
00:28:50 --> 00:28:56
then, F of s minus a will be,

476
00:28:53 --> 00:28:59
this will be good when s is
bigger than a.

477
00:28:57 --> 00:29:03
Why is that?
Well, because this is true.

478
00:29:02 --> 00:29:08
This is true.
If s minus a is

479
00:29:06 --> 00:29:12
positive, that's the condition.
That's what this Laplace

480
00:29:11 --> 00:29:17
transform is good.
But that simply says that s

481
00:29:15 --> 00:29:21
should be bigger than a.

482
00:29:18 --> 00:29:24
And, since this doesn't look
pretty, let me try to make it

483
00:29:23 --> 00:29:29
look a little bit prettier.
So, let's write it.

484
00:29:29 --> 00:29:35
So, this is assuming F of s is
for s greater than zero.

485
00:29:34 --> 00:29:40
Now, this is called something.

486
00:29:38 --> 00:29:44
This is called,
well, what would you call it?

487
00:29:43 --> 00:29:49
On the left side,
you multiply by an exponential.

488
00:29:47 --> 00:29:53
On the right,
you translate.

489
00:29:50 --> 00:29:56
You shift the argument over by
a.

490
00:29:53 --> 00:29:59
So, this is called,
gulp, the exponential shift.

491
00:29:58 --> 00:30:04
What?
Well, I'll call it the formula.

492
00:30:02 --> 00:30:08
The thing before,
when we talked about operators,

493
00:30:06 --> 00:30:12
we called it the exponential
shift rule or the exponential

494
00:30:10 --> 00:30:16
shift law.
But, in fact,

495
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
this is, in a way,
a disguised form of the same

496
00:30:16 --> 00:30:22
law.
And, engineers who typically do

497
00:30:19 --> 00:30:25
all their work using the Laplace
transform and don't use

498
00:30:23 --> 00:30:29
operators, this is the form of
the exponential shift law that

499
00:30:28 --> 00:30:34
they would know.
What you can do with one,

500
00:30:33 --> 00:30:39
you can do with the other.
You can now use both.

501
00:30:37 --> 00:30:43
So, what's the answer to e to
the a t?

502
00:30:41 --> 00:30:47
Well, the answer is,
I'm supposed to,

503
00:30:44 --> 00:30:50
e to the a t times one,
the Laplace transform of one is

504
00:30:48 --> 00:30:54
one over s.
And, therefore,

505
00:30:51 --> 00:30:57
what I do is to multiply by e
to the a t, I change s to s

506
00:30:56 --> 00:31:02
minus a .
And so, that's the answer.

507
00:31:00 --> 00:31:06
Let's see, what else don't we
know?

508
00:31:05 --> 00:31:11
Well, how about sines and
cosines?

509
00:31:08 --> 00:31:14
Well, the way to do sines and
cosines is by making the

510
00:31:15 --> 00:31:21
observation that this formula
also works when a is a complex

511
00:31:22 --> 00:31:28
number.
So, can use also for a a

512
00:31:26 --> 00:31:32
complex number, for e to 
the a plus b i times t.

513
00:31:31 --> 00:31:37
The Laplace transform of e to

514
00:31:37 --> 00:31:43
the a plus b i times t is one
over s minus a plus b i.

515
00:31:40 --> 00:31:46

516
00:31:43 --> 00:31:49
And again, it will be for s
bigger than a.

517
00:31:47 --> 00:31:53
So, let's calculate the Laplace
transform of,

518
00:31:50 --> 00:31:56
let's say, well,
I've got to cover up something.

519
00:31:54 --> 00:32:00
Okay, so, that's the Laplace
transform.

520
00:31:57 --> 00:32:03
I've got to remember that.
So, let's calculate the Laplace

521
00:32:02 --> 00:32:08
transform of,
let's say, sine of a t

522
00:32:05 --> 00:32:11
and cosine a t.

523
00:32:08 --> 00:32:14
What do you get for that?
Well, just for a little

524
00:32:12 --> 00:32:18
variety, we could do it by using
that formula,

525
00:32:15 --> 00:32:21
and taking its real and
imaginary parts.

526
00:32:18 --> 00:32:24
Since some of you had so much
difficulty with the backwards

527
00:32:23 --> 00:32:29
Euler formula,
he is a good case where you

528
00:32:26 --> 00:32:32
could use it.
Suppose you want to calculate

529
00:32:29 --> 00:32:35
the Laplace transform of cosine
a t.

530
00:32:35 --> 00:32:41
Well, I'm going to write that
using, I want to calculate using

531
00:32:39 --> 00:32:45
complex exponentials.
The way I will do it is by

532
00:32:43 --> 00:32:49
using the backwards Euler
formula.

533
00:32:45 --> 00:32:51
So, this is e to the i a t plus
e to the minus i a t divided by

534
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56
two.

535
00:32:52 --> 00:32:58
Remember, the foreword Euler
formula would say e to the i a t

536
00:32:57 --> 00:33:03
equals cosine a t plus i sine a
t.

537
00:33:01 --> 00:33:07
That expresses the complex

538
00:33:04 --> 00:33:10
exponential in terms of sines
and cosines.

539
00:33:07 --> 00:33:13
This is the backward formula,
which just read it backwards,

540
00:33:11 --> 00:33:17
expressing cosines and sines in
terms of complex exponentials

541
00:33:15 --> 00:33:21
instead.
Both formulas are useful,

542
00:33:17 --> 00:33:23
almost equally useful,
in fact.

543
00:33:19 --> 00:33:25
And anyway, just remind you of
it, let's use this one.

544
00:33:23 --> 00:33:29
Okay, what's the Laplace
transform, then,

545
00:33:26 --> 00:33:32
of cosine a t?
Well, by linearity,

546
00:33:30 --> 00:33:36
it's equal to one half the
Laplace transform of this guy

547
00:33:35 --> 00:33:41
plus the Laplace transform of
that guy.

548
00:33:38 --> 00:33:44
And, what are those?
Well, the Laplace transform of

549
00:33:43 --> 00:33:49
e to the i a t is one over s
minus i a,

550
00:33:48 --> 00:33:54
and the Laplace
transform of the other guy is

551
00:33:53 --> 00:33:59
one divided by s plus i a.

552
00:33:56 --> 00:34:02
Now, of course,
this has become out to be a

553
00:34:00 --> 00:34:06
real function.
This is real.

554
00:34:03 --> 00:34:09
Every integral is real.
This must come out to be real.

555
00:34:07 --> 00:34:13
This looks kind of complex,
but it isn't.

556
00:34:10 --> 00:34:16
I know automatically that this
is going to be a real function.

557
00:34:15 --> 00:34:21
How I know that?
Well, mentally,

558
00:34:17 --> 00:34:23
you can combine the terms and
calculate.

559
00:34:20 --> 00:34:26
But, I know even before that.
Remember, there are two ways to

560
00:34:24 --> 00:34:30
see that something is real.
You can calculate it and see

561
00:34:28 --> 00:34:34
that its imaginary part is zero,
hack, or without any

562
00:34:32 --> 00:34:38
calculation, if you change i to
minus i,

563
00:34:36 --> 00:34:42
and you get the same thing,
it must be real.

564
00:34:41 --> 00:34:47
Now, if I change i to minus i
in this expression,

565
00:34:45 --> 00:34:51
what happens?
If I change i to minus i,

566
00:34:48 --> 00:34:54
this term turns into that one,
and this one turns into that

567
00:34:54 --> 00:35:00
one.
Conclusion: the sum of the two

568
00:34:57 --> 00:35:03
is unchanged.
And therefore,

569
00:34:59 --> 00:35:05
this is real.
Well, of course,

570
00:35:03 --> 00:35:09
in the time I took to make that
argument, I could have actually

571
00:35:07 --> 00:35:13
calculated it.
So, what the heck,

572
00:35:09 --> 00:35:15
let's calculate it?
So, you do the high school

573
00:35:12 --> 00:35:18
thing, and it's this guy plus
that guy on top,

574
00:35:15 --> 00:35:21
which makes 2s.
I on the bottom is the product

575
00:35:18 --> 00:35:24
of those, which by now you
should know the product of two

576
00:35:22 --> 00:35:28
complex numbers.
A product of a number and its

577
00:35:25 --> 00:35:31
complex conjugate is the sum of
the squares.

578
00:35:29 --> 00:35:35
So, what's the answer?
The twos cancel,

579
00:35:31 --> 00:35:37
and the answer is that the
Laplace transform of cosine a t

580
00:35:35 --> 00:35:41
is s over s squared plus a
squared.

581
00:35:39 --> 00:35:45
And, that will be true as,

582
00:35:41 --> 00:35:47
in general, it's true up there
for positive values of s only.

583
00:35:46 --> 00:35:52
And, the sine a t,
you can calculate that in

584
00:35:49 --> 00:35:55
recitation tomorrow.
The answer to that is a divided

585
00:35:53 --> 00:35:59
by s squared plus a squared.

586
00:35:56 --> 00:36:02
You would get the same answers
if you took the real and

587
00:36:00 --> 00:36:06
imaginary parts of that
expression.

588
00:36:04 --> 00:36:10
It's another way of getting at
the recitations tomorrow;

589
00:36:08 --> 00:36:14
we'll get practice in
calculating other functions

590
00:36:11 --> 00:36:17
related to these by using these
formulas, and also from scratch

591
00:36:16 --> 00:36:22
directly from the definition of
the Laplace transform.

592
00:36:20 --> 00:36:26
Well, there are two things
which we still should do.

593
00:36:24 --> 00:36:30
The first is I want to get you
started with calculating inverse

594
00:36:29 --> 00:36:35
Laplace transforms.
And, the reason for doing that

595
00:36:33 --> 00:36:39
is, in other words,
I've started with f of t,

596
00:36:36 --> 00:36:42
and we've been focusing
on what is capital F of s?

597
00:36:40 --> 00:36:46
But, you will find that when

598
00:36:42 --> 00:36:48
you go to solve differential
equations, by far,

599
00:36:45 --> 00:36:51
the hardest part of the
procedure is you get F of s.

600
00:36:49 --> 00:36:55
The Laplace transform of the
answer, and you have to convert

601
00:36:52 --> 00:36:58
that back into the answer in
terms of t that you were looking

602
00:36:56 --> 00:37:02
for.
In other words,

603
00:36:58 --> 00:37:04
the main step in the procedure
that you are going to be using

604
00:37:01 --> 00:37:07
for solving differential
equations is,

605
00:37:04 --> 00:37:10
and the hardest part of the
step will be to calculate

606
00:37:07 --> 00:37:13
inverse laplace transforms.
Now, you think that could be

607
00:37:13 --> 00:37:19
done by tables,
but, in fact,

608
00:37:15 --> 00:37:21
it can't unless the tables are
too long to be useful.

609
00:37:19 --> 00:37:25
You have to do a certain amount
of work yourself.

610
00:37:23 --> 00:37:29
And, the certain amount of work
that you have to do yourself

611
00:37:28 --> 00:37:34
involves partial fractions
decompositions.

612
00:37:33 --> 00:37:39
And, in case you were wondering
which you are not,

613
00:37:36 --> 00:37:42
the reason you learned partial
fractions in 18.01 was not to

614
00:37:41 --> 00:37:47
learn those silly integrals,
but he learned it so that when

615
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
you got to 18.03 you would be
able to calculate,

616
00:37:48 --> 00:37:54
solve differential equations by
using Laplace transforms.

617
00:37:53 --> 00:37:59
Sorry.
That's life.

618
00:37:54 --> 00:38:00
Now, so a certain amount of the
recitation time tomorrow will be

619
00:37:59 --> 00:38:05
devoted to reminding you how to
do partial fractions since you

620
00:38:03 --> 00:38:09
haven't done it in a while,
and I assume,

621
00:38:06 --> 00:38:12
yeah, we had that,
I think.

622
00:38:10 --> 00:38:16
Okay, now, they also remind you
of the most efficient method,

623
00:38:16 --> 00:38:22
which about half of you have
had, and the rest think you

624
00:38:23 --> 00:38:29
might have had,
but really aren't sure.

625
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
So, here's the answer.
We want to find out what it's

626
00:38:33 --> 00:38:39
inverse Laplace transform is.
What you have to do,

627
00:38:39 --> 00:38:45
it normally won't be in the
tables like this.

628
00:38:42 --> 00:38:48
You have to put it in a form in
which it will be in the tables.

629
00:38:46 --> 00:38:52
As you do that,
you have to make partial

630
00:38:48 --> 00:38:54
fractions decompositions,
which, to do it quickly,

631
00:38:51 --> 00:38:57
so if you don't know what I'm
doing now, or you think you once

632
00:38:55 --> 00:39:01
knew but don't quite remember,
go to recitation tomorrow.

633
00:38:59 --> 00:39:05
To get the coefficient here,
I cover up s,

634
00:39:02 --> 00:39:08
and I put s equals zero
because that's the law.

635
00:39:07 --> 00:39:13
To get this coefficient,
I cover up s plus three and I

636
00:39:10 --> 00:39:16
put s equals a negative three
because that's what you're

637
00:39:14 --> 00:39:20
supposed to do.
Put s equal negative three,

638
00:39:17 --> 00:39:23
you get minus one third.
This is equal to that.

639
00:39:20 --> 00:39:26
In this form,
I don't know what the inverse

640
00:39:23 --> 00:39:29
Laplace form is,
but in this form,

641
00:39:25 --> 00:39:31
I certainly do know with the
inverse Laplace transform

642
00:39:29 --> 00:39:35
because the inverse Laplace
transform is linear,

643
00:39:32 --> 00:39:38
and because each of these guys
especially occurs in those

644
00:39:36 --> 00:39:42
tables.
Well, what's this?

645
00:39:40 --> 00:39:46
Well, it's whatever the Laplace
transform of,

646
00:39:43 --> 00:39:49
inverse Laplace transform of
one over s is multiplied by one

647
00:39:49 --> 00:39:55
third.
Well, the inverse Laplace

648
00:39:51 --> 00:39:57
transform of one over s is one.
So, it's one third times one.

649
00:39:56 --> 00:40:02
How about the other guy?
Minus one third,

650
00:40:00 --> 00:40:06
the inverse Laplace transform
of one over s plus three,

651
00:40:05 --> 00:40:11
that's this formula.
a is negative three,

652
00:40:09 --> 00:40:15
and that makes e to the minus
3t.

653
00:40:13 --> 00:40:19
So, if this was the Laplace
transform of the solution to the

654
00:40:18 --> 00:40:24
differential equation,
then the solution in terms of t

655
00:40:22 --> 00:40:28
was this function.
Now, you'll get lots of

656
00:40:26 --> 00:40:32
practice in that.
All I'm doing now is signaling

657
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36
that that's the most important
and difficult step of the

658
00:40:34 --> 00:40:40
procedure, and that,
please, start getting practice.

659
00:40:40 --> 00:40:46
Get up to snuff doing that
procedure.

660
00:40:42 --> 00:40:48
Okay, in the time remaining,
I want to add one formula to

661
00:40:46 --> 00:40:52
this list, and that is going to
be the Laplace transform of,

662
00:40:50 --> 00:40:56
we still haven't done
polynomials.

663
00:40:52 --> 00:40:58
And now, to polynomials,
because the Laplace transform

664
00:40:56 --> 00:41:02
is linear, all I have to do is
know what the Laplace transform

665
00:41:00 --> 00:41:06
of, the individual term of a
polynomial.

666
00:41:04 --> 00:41:10
In other words,
what the Laplace transform of t

667
00:41:07 --> 00:41:13
to the n,
where n is some positive

668
00:41:10 --> 00:41:16
integer?
Well, let's bravely start

669
00:41:13 --> 00:41:19
trying to calculate it.
Integral from zero to infinity

670
00:41:17 --> 00:41:23
t to the n e to the negative st
dt.

671
00:41:22 --> 00:41:28
Now, I think you can see that

672
00:41:26 --> 00:41:32
the method you should use is
integration by part because this

673
00:41:31 --> 00:41:37
is a product of two things,
one of which you would like to

674
00:41:35 --> 00:41:41
differentiate a lot of times,
in fact, and the other won't

675
00:41:40 --> 00:41:46
hurt to integrate it because
it's very easy to integrate.

676
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
So, this factor is going to be

677
00:41:48 --> 00:41:54
the one that's to be
differentiated,

678
00:41:50 --> 00:41:56
and this is the factor that
will be pleased to integrate it.

679
00:41:54 --> 00:42:00
Let's get started and see what
we can get out of it.

680
00:41:57 --> 00:42:03
Well, this time I'm going to
be, well, I'd better be a little

681
00:42:01 --> 00:42:07
careful because there's a point
here that's tricky.

682
00:42:06 --> 00:42:12
Okay, the first step of
integration by parts is you only

683
00:42:10 --> 00:42:16
do the integration.
You don't do the

684
00:42:12 --> 00:42:18
differentiation.
Remember, the variable is t.

685
00:42:15 --> 00:42:21
The s is just a parameter.
It's just a constant.

686
00:42:19 --> 00:42:25
It's hanging around,
not knowing what to do.

687
00:42:22 --> 00:42:28
Okay, so the first step is you
don't do the differentiation.

688
00:42:26 --> 00:42:32
You only do the integration.
Evaluate it between limits,

689
00:42:30 --> 00:42:36
and then you put a minus sign
before you forget to do it.

690
00:42:36 --> 00:42:42
And then, integral zero to
infinity.

691
00:42:38 --> 00:42:44
Now you do both operations.
So, it's n t to the n 

692
00:42:43 --> 00:42:49
minus one,
and you also do the

693
00:42:46 --> 00:42:52
integration.
Okay, let's consider each of

694
00:42:49 --> 00:42:55
these pieces in turn.
Now, this piece,

695
00:42:52 --> 00:42:58
well, there's no problem with
the lower limit,

696
00:42:55 --> 00:43:01
zero, because when t is equal
to zero, this factor is zero,

697
00:43:00 --> 00:43:06
and the thing disappears as
long as n is one or higher.

698
00:43:06 --> 00:43:12
So, it's minus zero here at the
lower limit.

699
00:43:10 --> 00:43:16
The question is,
what is at the upper limit?

700
00:43:15 --> 00:43:21
So, what I have to do is find
out, what is the limit?

701
00:43:20 --> 00:43:26
The limit, as t goes to
infinity, that's what's

702
00:43:25 --> 00:43:31
happening up there,
of t to the n times e to the

703
00:43:30 --> 00:43:36
negative s t divided
by minus s.

704
00:43:37 --> 00:43:43
Well, as t goes to infinity,
this goes to infinity,

705
00:43:40 --> 00:43:46
of course.
This had better go to zero

706
00:43:43 --> 00:43:49
unless I want an answer,
infinity, which won't do me any

707
00:43:46 --> 00:43:52
good.
If this goes to zero,

708
00:43:48 --> 00:43:54
s had better be positive.
So, I'd better be restricting

709
00:43:52 --> 00:43:58
myself to that case.
Okay, so let's assume that s is

710
00:43:56 --> 00:44:02
positive so that this minus s
really is a negative number.

711
00:44:01 --> 00:44:07
Okay, then I have a chance.
So, this is going to be the

712
00:44:04 --> 00:44:10
limit.
Let's write it in a more

713
00:44:06 --> 00:44:12
familiar form with that down
below.

714
00:44:08 --> 00:44:14
So, it's t to the n.
That's going to infinity.

715
00:44:12 --> 00:44:18
But, the bottom is e to the
minus s t.

716
00:44:15 --> 00:44:21
But now, it's plus s t.
And, that's going to infinity,

717
00:44:19 --> 00:44:25
too, because s is positive.
So, the two guys are racing,

718
00:44:23 --> 00:44:29
and the question is,
oh, I lost a minus s here.

719
00:44:26 --> 00:44:32
So, oh... equals minus
one over s.

720
00:44:30 --> 00:44:36
How's that?
So, the question is only,

721
00:44:33 --> 00:44:39
which guy wins?
In the race to infinity,

722
00:44:35 --> 00:44:41
which one wins,
and how do you decide?

723
00:44:38 --> 00:44:44
And, the answer,
of course, is that's the bottom

724
00:44:41 --> 00:44:47
that wins.
The exponential always wins,

725
00:44:43 --> 00:44:49
and it's because of L'Hopital's
rule.

726
00:44:45 --> 00:44:51
You differentiate top and
bottom.

727
00:44:47 --> 00:44:53
Nothing much happens to the
bottom.

728
00:44:49 --> 00:44:55
It gets another factor of s,
but the top goes down to t to

729
00:44:53 --> 00:44:59
the n minus one.
L'Hopital it again,

730
00:44:56 --> 00:45:02
and again, and again,
and again, and again until

731
00:44:59 --> 00:45:05
finally you've reduced the top
to t to the zero where it's

732
00:45:03 --> 00:45:09
defenseless and just sitting
there, and nothing's happened to

733
00:45:06 --> 00:45:12
the bottom.
It's still got e to the s t.

734
00:45:11 --> 00:45:17
and that goes to infinity.

735
00:45:14 --> 00:45:20
So, the answer is,
this is zero by n applications

736
00:45:19 --> 00:45:25
of L'Hopital's rule.
Or, if you're very clever,

737
00:45:23 --> 00:45:29
you can do it in one,
but I won't tell you how.

738
00:45:27 --> 00:45:33
So, the answer is that this is
zero.

739
00:45:32 --> 00:45:38
At the upper limit,
it's also zero at least if s is

740
00:45:35 --> 00:45:41
positive, which is the case
we're considering.

741
00:45:38 --> 00:45:44
That leaves the rest of this.
All right, let's pull the

742
00:45:41 --> 00:45:47
constants out front.
That's plus.

743
00:45:43 --> 00:45:49
Two negatives make a plus.
n over s,

744
00:45:46 --> 00:45:52
now, what's left?
The integral from zero to

745
00:45:49 --> 00:45:55
infinity of t to the n minus
one, e to the minus s t dt.

746
00:45:53 --> 00:45:59

747
00:45:57 --> 00:46:03
But, what on Earth is that?
That is n over s times

748
00:46:00 --> 00:46:06
the Laplace transform of t to
the n minus one.

749
00:46:04 --> 00:46:10
We got a reduction for it.
We don't get the answer in one

750
00:46:08 --> 00:46:14
step.
But, we get a reduction

751
00:46:11 --> 00:46:17
formula.
And, it says that the Laplace

752
00:46:13 --> 00:46:19
transform, let me write it this
way for once.

753
00:46:16 --> 00:46:22
The first way is now better,
is equal to n over s times the

754
00:46:20 --> 00:46:26
Laplace transform of n minus t
to the n minus one.

755
00:46:24 --> 00:46:30
Okay, the next step,

756
00:46:27 --> 00:46:33
this would be n over s times n
minus one over s times the

757
00:46:30 --> 00:46:36
Laplace transform of t to the n
minus two.

758
00:46:34 --> 00:46:40
If I can continue,

759
00:46:38 --> 00:46:44
I finally get in the top n
times n minus one times all the

760
00:46:44 --> 00:46:50
way down to one divided by the
same number of s's,

761
00:46:48 --> 00:46:54
n of them, times the Laplace
transform of t to the zero,

762
00:46:53 --> 00:46:59
finally.
See, one, zero,

763
00:46:55 --> 00:47:01
n minus one.
And so, what's the final

764
00:46:59 --> 00:47:05
answer?
It is n factorial over s to the

765
00:47:02 --> 00:47:08
what power?
Well, the Laplace transform of

766
00:47:07 --> 00:47:13
this is one over s.
So, the answer is it's s to the

767
00:47:13 --> 00:47:19
n plus one,
n of them here plus an extra

768
00:47:18 --> 00:47:24
one coming from the one over s
here.

769
00:47:21 --> 00:47:27
And, that's the answer.
The Laplace transform of t to

770
00:47:26 --> 00:47:32
the n, oddly enough,

771
00:47:29 --> 00:47:35
is more complicated,
and looks a little different

772
00:47:33 --> 00:47:39
from these.
It's n factorial over s to the

773
00:47:37 --> 00:47:43
