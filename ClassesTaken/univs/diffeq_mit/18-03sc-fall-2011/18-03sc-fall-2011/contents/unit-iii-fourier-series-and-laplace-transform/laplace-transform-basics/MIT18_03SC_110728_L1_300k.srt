1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,030
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,180
So in this session we're going
to look at Laplace transform.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,170
And we'll start with asking you
to recall the definition

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,400
that you saw in class, then to
use the definition to compute

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,680
the Laplace transform of the
function 1, exponential At,

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,140
and the delta function.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,950
For each one of these, give the
domain of definition or

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,240
convergence of the
od integral.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,410
For the last question, you're
asked to use the results of

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,000
question 2 to give the Laplace
transform of this linear

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,330
combination of functions.

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,840
In the last part, you're asked
to compute Laplace transform,

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,810
cosine and sine.

15
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,060
So why don't you pause the
video, take a few minutes, and

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,310
work through that.

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:53,360

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,670
Welcome back.

19
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,920
So let's start with
the definition.

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,630

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:06,640
Laplace transform of the
function s was defined as the

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,790
integral from 0 minus to
infinity of the function f of

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:16,340
t exponential minus st dt.

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,930
So note here, the interval
of integration

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,150
is 0 minus to infinity.

26
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,310
So using this definition, we can
go ahead and compute our

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,820
first Laplace transform,
L of 1.

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,580
So I'm just going to substitute
1 in that integral,

29
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:40,980
which gives me basically
exponential minus st dt, which

30
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,980
is just the integral of the
exponential minus st over

31
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,450
minus s from 0 minus
to infinity.

32
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,925
And if I expend this, basically,
I end up with 1/s.

33
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:57,260

34
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,020
The minus reverses the order
of integration, so I start

35
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,840
with 0, which is 1, minus the
limit when t goes to infinity,

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,930
my exponential minus st.

37
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,850
So here the sign of s
becomes important.

38
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,240
If s was positive, then this
term would go to 0 as t goes

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,130
to infinity.

40
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,570
If s is negative, then this term
diverges, and so we're

41
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,210
not anymore in the domain
of convergence

42
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,690
of the Laplace integral.

43
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,710
But really, s could
be also complex.

44
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,800
So what we're interested in
is really the sign of the

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,050
real part of s.

46
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,020

47
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,880
So if the real part of s is
positive, this term is goes to

48
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,780
0, and the Laplace transform
of 1 is just 1/s.

49
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,500
And if the real part
of s is negative,

50
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,270
then the Laplace diverges.

51
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,680

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,680
So the domain of convergence in
which you want to be on is

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,500
the one where the real part
of s is positive.

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:01,810
OK.

55
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,840
So let's move to
the second one.

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,510
The second one is a Laplace
of exponential at.

57
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:18,330
So we can move a bit faster now,
and just merge the two

58
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,580
exponentials.

59
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:25,410

60
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:32,052
Exponential minus 0 to infinity
to 0 to infinity of

61
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:33,860
this exponential.

62
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:42,260
Clearly this is just, again,
a case of exponential

63
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,780
integration between
the two bounds.

64
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,950
And here again we're going to
hint a problem with the domain

65
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,920
of convergence where we need--

66
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,970
so let me just write
these again.

67
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,250
So we're going to have
here a minus--

68
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,235
so we have our a minus s.

69
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:05,520

70
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,860
So we have the limit again when
t goes to infinity of

71
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,850
exponential minus s plus
a capital T minus 1.

72
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,440

73
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,970
And here, again, we need to
impose the condition that the

74
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,430
real part of a minus s be
negative to have the domain of

75
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,570
convergence of the integral.

76
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,720
And then we're left with the
Laplace interval being over 1

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,700
over s minus a.

78
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,545
If the real part is positive,
then we have divergence.

79
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:50,340

80
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,630
So the domain of convergence
of this Laplace is the one

81
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,280
defined by the real part of a
less than the real part of s.

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,560
OK.

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,190
So let's do the last one.

84
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,450
The last one is the Laplace
transform of the delta

85
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,765
function that we saw before.

86
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:09,220

87
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:17,705
That's 0 minus to infinity delta
exponential minus st dt.

88
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:21,100
So from the previous
recitations, we saw that on

89
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,670
this domain, from 0 minus to
infinity, the delta is 0

90
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,580
everywhere except at 0, where we
basically assigned a value

91
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,550
of this function at
t equal to 0.

92
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,890
So basically we're
just left with

93
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,950
exponential 0, which is 1.

94
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,090
And this computation was
really easy, due to the

95
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,890
properties of the
delta function.

96
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,550
So that ends roughly this first
part, except that you

97
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,930
can also notice here that the
domain of convergence for the

98
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,180
Laplace for delta is all s.

99
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,430
There's no condition.

100
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:59,210

101
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,760
So the last part, next question,
asked us to compute

102
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,100
the Laplace transform
of a linear

103
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,970
combination of functions.

104
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:18,200
So this one is 7 plus 8
exponential 2t plus 9

105
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,470
exponential minus 3t.

106
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,570

107
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,070
So here I've used solely Laplace
as an integral, and so

108
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,680
the Laplace transform of this
linear combination of

109
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,600
functions is the linear
combination of the Laplace

110
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,880
transform of the functions
individually.

111
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:45,195
And so we can just rewrite this
as 7 Laplace of 1 plus 8

112
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:51,120
Laplace of exponential
2t plus 9 Laplace

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,040
exponential minus 3t.

114
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,010
And here we can see how we can
recycle the results from the

115
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,290
previous part, as we computed
the Laplace transform of 1,

116
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,340
and we computed the Laplace
transform exponential at,

117
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,830
which we're going to be able to
apply in these two cases.

118
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,590
So we can write the results
directly here.

119
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,030
And I'm just going to not
rewrite everything, just

120
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,550
include it.

121
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,580
So the Laplace of 1, we found
it earlier to be 1/s.

122
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,030

123
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,450
The Laplace of exponential 2t we
just found here, and would

124
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,030
be s minus 2.

125
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,720

126
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,550
The Laplace of exponential
minus 3t would be s minus

127
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,950
minus 3, so it's s plus
3 with the 9.

128
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,750

129
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,630
And we're done.

130
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,130
So for the last part, you're
asked to compute the Laplace

131
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,090
transfer of cosine and
sine, and you should

132
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,140
know these by heart.

133
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,710
But just a trick to
remember it--

134
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,280

135
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,050
I just want to remind you,
again, of the linearity and

136
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,910
the fact that you could
also use the formula.

137
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,000

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,730
Given what we just derived,
you could also write this,

139
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:13,310
again due to the linearity of
the integral as a linear

140
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,270
combination of Laplace of
cosine and sine here.

141
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,610
And we know that the Laplace of
the exponential at is just

142
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,290
what we computed here.

143
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:27,040
So that would be s minus i
omega, which you can just

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,090
rewrite like this.

145
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,632
And then identify just the real
part with the real part,

146
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:37,419
the imaginary part with the
imaginary part, which finishes

147
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,549
our problem.

148
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,890
And this is a quick way
of checking that

149
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,250
you have that, right?

150
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:51,631
To give you the Laplace
transforms of cosine and sine.

151
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,780

152
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,470
So that ends the problem
for today.

153
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,600
The key point was just
remembering the definition of

154
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,200
the Laplace transform, and then
learning how to use it

155
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,500
for different cases, and
identify the domains of

156
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,750
convergence.

157
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,437
