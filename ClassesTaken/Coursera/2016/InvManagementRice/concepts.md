Metrics
--
-   Return
    -   Holding period return (C4M1L1): return over a given period
        -   gross return (v1 / v0)
        -   *rate of return* or net return (v1 / v0 - 1)
    -   EAR (C4M1L1) or effective annual return: EAR = (1+APR/m)^m-1 where
        APR is the annual nominal rate and m is the number of compounding
        periods per year.
    -   Cumulative return (C4M1L1): multiply period growths and subtract 1
    -   Continuously compounded return (C4M1L1)
    -   geometric average vs. arithmetic average (C4M1L1)
    -   Annualized returns (C4M1L1): compound by number of periods if using
        geometric average, simply multiply if using arithmetic average
    -   Internal rate of return (C4M1L1): same as dollar-weighted return
    -   Time vs. dollar-weighted returns (C4M1L1)
    -   Excess return (C4M1L1)
        -   Geometric (compound) excess return (C4M1L1): rx = (rp - rb) / (1 + rb)
