1   The death rate for treatment and control group is
    almost identical: 27/1000 vs. 28/1000

2   No. Accepting screening is observational.
3   A natural experiment. Assignment was randomized by
    nature. Moving the water source is what created the
    only difference between the groups.
4   Observational. Each union determined whether or not
    it would use poor houses or out-relief.
5   If the coefficient had been -0.755, he would have had
    to conclude that out-relief causes a decrease in poverty.
    If it had been 0.005, one would conclude that the
    proportion of out-relief to poor houses has no bearing
    on poverty.
6   E(Sn) = n * mu
    Var(Sn) = n * sigmaSq
    E(Sn/n) = mu
    Var(Sn/n) = sigmaSq / n
7   E(Sn) = n * p
    Var(Sn) = n * p * (1 - p)
    E(Sn/n) = p
    Var(Sn/n) = p * (1 - p) / n
8   For an experiment conducted n times, the average
    result approaches the mean as n approaches infinity.
9   No. The rating of the ability to control pain is
    observational. Moreover, the group size is small and
    the length of the trial is short. One explanation:
    On days when they had less pain, they attributed this
    fact to the religious coping methods.
10  I agree that association isn't causation. An excellent
    example is the high (0.74) correlation between number
    of telephone lines per capita and breast cancer death
    rates.
